# 0004. Supported browsers

Date: 2021-05-21

## Status

Pending

## Context

We need to conclude which browsers (and potentially versions) we will include in our testing scope.

## Proposal

To align our supported browsers with  Microsoft and NHS Digital browser support.

Microsoft Internet Explorer has reached end-of-life in the Microsoft Lifecycle Policy and NHS Digital has subsequently moved to [stop supporting Internet Explorer](https://digital.nhs.uk/about-nhs-digital/standards-for-web-products/withdrawal-of-support-for-internet-explorer).

Shown below are the list of browsers we intend to test our application with:-

### Windows

- Edge (latest versions)
- Google Chrome (latest versions) 
- Mozilla Firefox (latest versions) 

### MacOS

- Safari 12 and later 
- Google Chrome (latest versions) 
- Mozilla Firefox (latest versions) 

### iOS

- Safari for iOS 10.3 and later 
- Google Chrome (latest versions)

### Android

- Google Chrome (latest versions)
- Samsung Internet (latest versions)


### Current FutureNHS usage breakdown by device:

- Desktop: 82.89%
- Tablet: 9.8%
- Mobile: 7.31%
