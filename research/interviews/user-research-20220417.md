# FutureNHS User Research - 17th April 2022

## User Reserach Overview 

**Research aim**
- To review early registration journey designs with non-existing users of the platform and understand pain points or opportunities

**Session Overview**
- Persona validation & User background
- Role in the NHS / related organisation & how they collaborate as part of their role to identify persona group
- Any existing knowledge of the platform

**Registration**
- Counterbalanced research plan (see appendix) to observe interaction with and gather feedback on the following journey designs:
- Happy path – single form desktop
- Happy path – split form desktop
- Happy path – single form mobile
- Happy path split form mobile
- Unhappy path – desktop

## Methodology

For this round of research we used a remote moderated one-to-one user research methodology. The sessions were conducted via video conference and screen sharing meeting on Teams, and participants joined from their desktop. The moderator and participant could see and hear each other in order to conduct the interview. Chat functionality allowed the moderator to provide instructions, and links to the wireframes. Participants accessed the platform & wireframes on their desktop and shared their screen. The moderator was able to see the participant’s screen and used concurrent think aloud (CTA) to understand their behaviour and asked interview questions.

## User Background

We interviewed 6 non-members of the platform, 3 members of the platform. We also interviewed 8 NHS staff members and 1 non-NHS member. 

## User Summary

## Summary Findings

**What Went Well?**

- Overall, users across all journeys and designs felt the registration process was simple and straightforward as it largely matched their expectations of an NHS sign up process​
- The familiar branding and design made the process easy to follow and gave users confidence that this was a legitimate platform supported by the NHS
- Users who completed the ‘unhappy path’ journey still felt the process was simple and easy to follow despite having to take extra measures to get access
- All users would feel confident going through the live registration process based on their experience on the prototypes

**What Needs to be Improved**

- Across all journeys, users wanted to see more information upfront in the process to explain what the FutureNHS platform is, what they can use it for, and what the benefit is to joining​
- The ‘Other’ job role and organisation fields were not always intuitive causing confusion around what these should be used for
- Users rarely noticed or understood the other login options related to single sign on and felt these should be better signposted and explained
- On the unhappy path journey, users wanted to see contact details present at various points in case they needed to get support or chase their request for access
- On the unhappy path journey, users wanted to understand how long they should expect to wait for their request to access to be approved

## Registration - Happy Path

### Invite Email

**The invite email was understood but lacked supporting information**

- Users understood this was an invite to the platform, but having never heard of the platform before, felt the email was too brief and did not encourage them to join. They wanted to see supporting information around FutureNHS, including what it is, and benefits of joining​
- In terms of design, users did not feel the email was enticing. They perceived it as ‘corporate’, due to the plain black text on a white background and generic NHS logo​
- Some explained they may perceive the email as spam due to the generic copy and limited supporting information. The combination of limited trust, and being extremely time poor meant they may not action the email until told to do so from someone internal​
- Users felt it was clear they should ‘click here’ to register to the platform, and expected this to take them to a form where they would enter personal details such as name, email address, job role etc.​
- One user suggested making the link a button (CTA) to make it clear this was the key action​
- One user suggested adding contact details in case invitees are unsure why they are receiving this email​

**Scenario**
- You have recently joined a new team at work and as part of your onboarding you’ve been asked to get setup on the various platforms and systems the team use. You have received the following email relating to the ‘FutureNHS’ platform. Please continue however you normally would. ​

### Register Form - Understanding

**The form met users’ registration expectations, but supporting information was not always clear**

- Users explained the form met their expectations for the registration process​
- Some got started by filling in the form fields and explained they would not read supporting information unless they ran into a problem as they do not have time​
- Those with NHS emails would expect to be accepted anyway​
- Some got started by reading the supporting information hoping this would provide more context to the platform. They felt it was useful to understand who could register but still wanted a general description of the platform​
- One user questioned why they would still need to get approval or verification if they had been invited​
- Users understood they could use the ‘click here’ links for more information on permitted vs non-permitted emails. The non-NHS user explained they would click this to save wasting time if they were not permitted​
- However, one user felt the information at the top of the page was repeated within the yellow box and was unsure why there were two ‘click here’ links as they assumed these would take them to the same place​

### Register Form - Field Completion

**Users misinterpreted or faced confusion around the ‘Other’ fields**

- Although most assumed it would be their work / NHS email they needed to enter, one user explained that clinicians will often use their personal emails instead, so suggested adding an explicit prompt to state use of NHS email if you have one​
- There was initial confusion over the ‘other’ fields for job role and organisation. Users initially thought this may be for them to add a second job role, or organisation they work for alongside their primary role​
- After the moderator explained the purpose of this field, some users suggested adding supporting information with the field heading such as ‘if your job role is not listed, please fill in the field below’​
- Some users suggested having an ‘other’ option within the drop down and only making the free-text field visible once this is selected​
- One user felt that if the ‘other’ field was not mandatory, this should clearly be stated as optional

**Users expected to see T&Cs and were happy to accept these**

- Users were not surprised to be asked to accept T&Cs as they felt this was common practice when signing up to a new service or platform​
- Most explained they would not read T&Cs as they were only going to be using the platform in a work capacity and assumed the platform would be trusted anyway if it had been recommended / was by the NHS​
- A few said they may have a quick scan of the T&Cs to check there was nothing surprising in there, particularly those wanting to use the platform to share content​
- One user suggested adding the opportunity to sign up to the newsletter here as this usually appears alongside any T&C requirements​

- Upon clicking ‘Register’ users expected to be taken:​
- To be asked to verify their email; ​
- To a page to set a password; or 
- Straight into the platform

### Register Form - Layout and Design

**Users felt the form looked familiar and was a suitable length for a single page**

- Some users commented the design felt familiar and trustworthy, as it looked similar to other NHS forms​
- Although commenting that it was not exciting to look at, users felt it the form was simple and straightforward​
- Most felt it was not a large amount of information so it was fine for all fields to be on one page​
- Some also acknowledged that this it was useful to see upfront the amount of information required in a single form, so that they could realistically gauge how long it would take them to complete and reduce the number of clicks​
- Even those who were time poor, particularly frontline workers, explained they would be happy to fill this in based on its short length and simplicity​

### Split Screen Form

**Although all users completed the split screen form with ease, some preferred to see all fields on a single form**

- All users continued through each page with ease, and some commented it seemed similar to other NHS or government sign up processes​
- When asked to compare the 2 approaches, most explained they’d prefer to see all fields on a single form as it reduces the amount of clicks, and allows them to gauge how long it will take to complete​
- Some suggested adding a progress indicator to the split screen version to help them understand where they were in the process​
- One user commented that the advantage of a split screen is the opportunity to add supporting information, and that users may be more likely to read this if they just have one thing to focus on at a time, therefore leading to less errors​
- Some felt the use of the check box to reveal the ‘other’ job and organisation fields reduced confusion, as it was clear they could click this if theirs was not available ​
- Others suggested the checkbox may get missed, leading to wasted time scrolling the lists to find a suitable job role. They suggested adding a ‘My job is not listed’ option at the top of the drop down instead​

### Mobile Form Response

**Users completed the registration form on mobile with ease and preferred the single page version**

- Both users who completed the form on a mobile display did so with ease and commented the form was easy to navigate and did not seem too long for a single screen​
- When asked, both users preferred the single form as it required less clicks and they could easily gauge how long it would take to complete​

### Thankyou for Registering

**Users understood they must go to their emails to activate their account, and most felt this was expected**

- Upon reaching the ‘Thank you for registering’ screen, users understood that they must now go to their email to activate their account​
- Most felt this was standard practice and what they would expect as part of registration​
- However one user questioned why they had to go through this extra step when they had been invited to the platform​
- Most said they hoped this would come through instantly, so their next steps would be to go to their emails to continue the process​
- They explained if the email was not yet there, they may come back to it later​
- Some clinical staff explained their next steps would depend on how urgent they needed platform access. They may not have time to complete activation straight away so this may wait until they next get a chance to check their emails in non-clinical time​
- One user explained that some users may be coming to the platform to access content urgently, so suggested setting expectations earlier on around whether they will have to verify / how long it will take​

### Activation Email

**Users understood how to activate their account and continue to the platform**

- Users understood that they must click the link to activate their account. Most explained they would not read the content in detail as this was a kind of email they were familiar with​
- In terms of where the link would take them;​
- Most expected this to take them back to the platform where they could set a password and login ​
- Some expected this to take them directly into the platform, already logged in​

### Set Password Screen

**Most were not surprised to land here, and all completed the required fields with ease**

- Most were not surprised to land here and be asked to set a password to complete registration​
- However, those who expected to be taken directly into the platform were initially surprised to be asked to set login information. They felt this could have been asked when entering their other details on the registration form​
- Users were able to set a password and security question with ease​
- They felt the password criteria was appropriate without being too challenging, and felt it was useful to see this upfront rather than receiving an error if it did not match​
- Users felt security questions were useful to recover their account if they forget their password​
- They expected ‘standard’ questions to be included such as Mother’s Maiden name, Name of first pet, Place of birth, Primary School etc.​
- Most users expected to be taken straight to the platform next, so felt the additional ‘Your registration is complete!’ page was unnecessary​

### Login Screen

**Users would sign in using their FutureNHS details, rarely noticing or understanding the single sign on options**

- Users were naturally drawn to the sign in fields and explained they would enter the email and password they had just setup​
- Some were surprised to be asked to login at this point. As they had only just signed up, they felt they should be logged in automatically​
- Some thought it was useful to be asked to login as it allowed them to save their login details, either using the ‘Remember me’ option or browser features​
- Until prompted, most were not drawn to the alternative login options​
- On review, there was some confusion around what these would be used for, whether they would be logging in to a separate platform or just using the credentials to login to FutureNHS​
- NHS staff were mostly aware of NHS mail but explained they would still login using the FutureNHS credentials they had created as it felt ‘more straightforward’ to keep these logins separate​
- Most were unaware what OKTA or NHS England Apps referred to​
- After explaining the single sign on options to users, most saw the benefit of this feature, and felt it should explained on screen​
- However most explained they would only these if they were having difficulty using their credentials for FutureNHS​

### My Groups Landing Page

**Desktop users understood where they were and would go on to access their group. Mobile users hesitated more when landing on the page**

- Based on the title ‘My groups’ desktop users had a good understanding of where were on the platform. They understood the visible group was the one they had been invited to join and were now a member of. They felt it was useful to be directed straight here as it made the journey feel joined up​
- Most users noticed the option to ‘Take the tour’ but explained they would start by trying to figure out the platform themselves, only using this if they were struggling​
- Some would avoid onboarding like this as they considered it too time-consuming​
- Most users explained their next steps at this point would be to click on the group and explore it​
- Mobile users seemed to have more difficulty understanding where they were on the platform. This may have been because of the missing ‘My groups’ heading, but also because they had to scroll to see the group they had been invited to​

### Registration Successful Email

**Users felt it was useful to receive the confirmation email but wanted a link included for future access**

- When asked if there was anything else they would expect to happen after successfully registering, no users mentioned receiving an email notification. However most felt it was useful to receive this confirmation email, and said this was fairly standard practice​
- Some said they may also use this email to return to the platform if they had not bookmarked the site. For this reason, they hoped to see a link to the platform here​
- Some suggested it would be good to see information here, or in a separate email, welcoming them to the platform and informing them what they could do now they are registered​
