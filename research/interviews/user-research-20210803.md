# FutureNHS User Research - 3rd August 2021
## Objective
The focus of this research was to build an understanding of needs and current usage of Workspace homepages on the site, and to gather responses to early UX designs homepage design templates. On the current Kahootz platform, we were interested in:
* Creating and managing a workspace homepage (managers)
*	Using a workspace homepage (members)
*	Group homepage template setup journey [see here] (managers)
*	Group homepage template designs (members)
*	Stream / feed
*	Blocks
*	Files & Folders
*	Discussions

## Methodology
For this round of research we used a remote moderated one-to-one user research methodology. The sessions were conducted via video conference and screen sharing meeting on Teams, and participants joined from their desktop. The moderator and participant could see and hear each other in order to conduct the interview. Chat functionality allowed the moderator to provide instructions, and links to the wireframes. Participants accessed the platform & wireframes on their desktop and shared their screen. The moderator was able to see the participant’s screen and used concurrent think aloud (CTA) to understand their behaviour and asked interview questions.

## User Background
We interviewed 2 members who used the platform to keep up to date and share information across organisations. We interviewed 6 workspace managers with varying levels of experience, who use the platform to enable sharing and manage and edit content. We also interviewed 2 stakeholders.

## Summary

### Managers - Kahootz - Workspace Homepage
*	Most organised their homepage according to what they thought was the key or most used content on their workspace
*	Most felt the process of editing their homepage was straightforward due to familiarity but often raised frustrations such as not being able to preview changes or save a draft
*	Documents, folders and forums were amongst the most used content features, and icon buttons, text, and accordion / carousel were the most used items

### Members – Kahootz – Getting Started & Workspace Homepage
*	Members did not naturally visit the workspace homepage when accessing or viewing content on the platform
*	They were usually directed to the platform from an email notification, the link from which they would use to access the discussion forum or content directly

### Managers Wireframes 
*	Although most understood what to do on the template choice page, some wanted to see previews and more detailed descriptions to aid their decision
*	5 out of 7 in the qualitative test and 61% in the quantitative test opted for the ‘Content block’ template due to flexibility
*	Most liked the option to ‘Save and preview’ before publishing as this is currently unavailable
*	Overall most liked the templated approach and felt this was easier, though some had concerns around limited flexibility and creativity

### Stakeholders & Members - Wireframes
*	Stakeholder felt the templated approach addresses current issues with Kahootz well but may receive initial resistance
*	2 out of 2 members in the qualitative test preferred the ‘Content block’ layout due to having more content variety
*	77% of members in the quantitative test chose the ‘Content block’ layout as it ha more navigational options and seemed more ‘user friendly’

## Managers - Kahootz Workspace Homepage

### Kahootz Workspace homepage – organisation & design decisions

*	Not all managers were responsible for the Workspace Homepage as they sometimes only managed a subsection of a workspace, though all had some responsibility to manage and edit pages
*	Most managers had organised their homepage according to what they believed were the most used or priority areas for members
*	Many had created a series of buttons or links at the top of the page linking to these areas, explaining that this was not used as a browsing site but more as a gateway to specific content or resources that members needed to access as quickly as possible
*	Priority areas usually included:
*	Discussion forums
*	Events
*	Most recent content or discussions
*	Sub-topic areas
*	A number of managers had knowledge or experience in web design and wanted to make their workspace user friendly, especially for less tech savvy or accessibility users 
*	Some managers were keen to make their workspace as visual as possible as they believed this made it more engaging, so had added an image or carousel to the top of the homepage

## Kahootz Workspace Homepage – Creating & Editing Content

- Most managers felt the editing process was straightforward due to familiarity, but most had frustrations

*	When initially asked most managers felt the process of creating and editing their workspace homepage was relatively easy, and explained the help pages and service desk had helped them build their knowledge
*	When asked to show us how they would edit their homepage, some quickly navigated to the ‘Configure dashboard’ icon to do this, whereas others hesitated, explaining this wasn’t a page they edited often and the icons were not intuitive 
*	Users raised areas of frustration or confusion when it came to editing their homepages, including: 
*	Not being able to preview changes or save a draft before going live (3 users)
*	Limited flexibility in sizing and spacing (2 users)
*	No auto saving (1 user)
*	Being unsure what exactly the member sees vs what is part of their view as a manager (1 user)
*	No edit log – can’t see if anyone has made changes (1 user)
*	Limited icon library (1 user)
*	Not being able to link events to a meeting invite or a registration page (1 user)

Most had identified specific content they felt worked well and used these regularly, these typically included: 
*	Document
*	Folder
*	Forum
*	Web link
*	Icon
*	Carousel
*	Calendar

The same applied to items with the most used being: 
*	Icon button
*	Accordion / Carousel
*	Events / Calendar
*	Text and images

Less used features, with many explaining they were unsure what these were or would do, included: 
*	Task list 
*	Web page 
*	Case study
*	Database
*	Surveys
*	Ticker
*	Photo album

## Kahootz Workspace Homepage - Opportunities

- Some managers mentioned additional features they felt would add value to their homepage
  
Some managers mentioned additional features or functionality they wanted to be able to add to their workspace homepage, these included:

*	Contact information for regional leads
*	To show a preview of the forum - key to drive engagement & spark conversations

## Stakeholder – Kahootz Workspace Homepages

- Stakeholders shared the real variety of workspace homepage designs due to flexibility on the current platform, through acknowledged this creates challenges
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139663883-0ba1d02f-870c-4dbd-b142-c5a80d3d7cc9.png)
  
* Stakeholders informed us that there is a real variety of use cases for workspaces homepages. This is possibly due to the flexibility and ‘free reign’ that managers have at the moment
*	Whilst the flexibility is great in allowing workspaces to best suit the needs of their members, it also creates challenges:
*	Managers do not always have a technical or design background making homepage creation challenging and requiring additional support & training
*	Currently too much choice and little clarity on what different features should be used for leads to incorrect use of features
*	Because the platform is free, many will use it despite it not necessarily being the correct solution for their needs
*	Stakeholders saw the need for a ‘flexible template’ providing a framework to build within but with some flexibility

## Members – Kahootz – Getting Started & Workspace Homepage
### Kahootz – Getting Started * Workspace Homepage

- Members use of workspace homepages was limited as they were usually directed to updates or content from email notifications
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139663996-1f1ee017-9006-427b-8457-934eb30a81e5.png)
  
*	Members did not naturally engage with the workspace homepage when getting started or accessing the platform. They explained they usually accessed content directly form an email notification
*	If for any reason they wanted to revisit something or find specific content, they may come to the homepage to do this but explained this was very rare and they may just use the search function instead
*	One member explained their interaction was mostly with the discussion forum and that this was typically used to signpost & direct members to relevant content on the workspace
*	When asked to review their workspace homepage, one user felt this was very ‘busy’ and contained lots of sections and information not relevant to them, making it difficult to figure out where they should go 

## Managers - Wireframes

### Wireframes – Choosing a template

- Most understood they must choose a template to proceed, though some wanted additional examples or explanations to help them choose
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139664040-54c06f60-431f-499a-be90-4929ac452f2b.png)
  
*	Most managers understood what they were required to do at this point, and got started by reviewing the options and deciding which would be most appropriate for them
*	Although most responded positively to creating a homepage via templates, some were initially resistant, explaining workspaces were customised and ‘don’t fit into boxes’
*	One user did not initially realise they had to choose one of these, and thought they were ‘Blocks’ of which they could choose multiple to build the page. They felt the description should be more specific to help them understand what they needed to do
*	Some had difficulty making a decision based on the icons and descriptions alone and suggested adding preview images to help them choose the most appropriate
*	Managers wanted to understand how rigid these templates were and whether they would be able to still add other types of content, especially if later down the line the scope of their workspace changed. They were afraid they may have to start again from scratch

#### 5 out of & managers would choose the ‘Content Block’ template due to flexibility
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139664086-582cb301-0e0c-4ebc-bc2e-c93d9fbe52f0.png)

*	Out of the 7 managers who saw the template options, 5 opted for the ‘Content blocks options’ due to the perceived flexibility allowing them to include different types of content, and many explaining this seemed similar to the current setup on Kahootz
*	2 managers chose the forums first approach as the forum was the most used area of their workspace
*	Some with smaller or newer workspaces explained they would not choose the Stream/Feed or Discussion first templates as there was not enough activity on their workspace

## Wireframes – Choosing a template – Quantitative Test

- 61% of managers chose the ‘Content blocks’ template due to more flexibility and opportunities to customise
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139665684-985b8bb5-9af3-43bf-985f-4bbf11c480e1.png)

28 managers took part in the quantitative test

Before seeing the template options, users were asked ‘When you create a workspace, which of the following apply to you?’
*	61% answered ‘I'd prefer to choose between some ready-made templates’
*	29% answered ‘I enjoy designing a workspace from scratch’
*	11% answered ‘I'd like the platform to generate a standard template for me’

When presented with the four template options: 
*	61% chose the ‘Content blocks’
*	7% chose ‘Stream / feed; 
*	7% chose ‘Documents first’
*	4% chose ‘Forum first’

*	Those who picked content blocks said this was due to it providing more flexibility and opportunities to customise content and design

*	93% said they were ‘Very confident’ or ‘Somewhat confident’ with their choice

## Wireframes – Content blocks – editing the page

### Managers understood how to get started editing the page, but wanted further clarity on functionality and options
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139664240-a127eb59-050d-4eb7-b332-c869231d4e7e.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139664246-b15d158c-b7ec-471b-8edd-6e1c0d1dfe93.png)

*	Most users got started editing their page with ease and felt it was clear how they would get started editing or deleting blocks
*	Some initially missed the header block at the top of the page, explaining they assumed all editable content sat below the calls to action ‘Save draft’ and ‘Save and preview page’.
*	A number of managers wanted to be able to move blocks around with some explaining that the ‘Key links’ were something they would want at the top, or a need to spotlight any key updates
*	When editing the header block, some questioned whether there was a word limit for the descriptions and felt this should be specified
*	A number of users were unsure what the options to ‘Include a forum page’, ‘…files page’, ‘…members page’ were for, explaining there should be a tooltip or contextual help to explain these
*	Once realising what these were, some users commented it was confusing to be asked to add these before creating any kind of site structure and questioned at what point they would do this
*	However most responded positively to the option to add these to the header explaining these were key areas and provides a clear entry point

### Managers liked the Introduction block, but questioned how it would appear & there was a mixed respond to the Group Summary
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139666456-04f0d094-39fc-437d-b49f-2753eae71f68.png)

*	In the Group Introduction block, users liked the fact the image was formatted for them as many had had difficulty formatting pictures on Kahootz.
*	Some questioned whether the introduction block would need to appear consistently, and suggested a hide function to maximise screen space for familiar members
*	There was a mixed response to the group summary as whilst some said this was useful to see, those particularly with less active groups said they would may not want this visible to all members and instead would want it for auditing purposes only
*	When adding ‘Essential links’ users liked the option to add icons but hoped there would be a library to choose from for ease and consistency. 
*	Some were also unsure whether they could link to external pages as internal pages and explained they hope they would be able to

### Some wanted to see ‘Most recent’ rather then ‘Popular’ discussions, and there were mixed views on how popular pages should be populated
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139666502-799cfaa6-0122-42a7-b003-e7f90a810834.png)

*	Although most liked being able to see a preview of discussions under ‘Popular Discussions’ which wasn’t available on the current platform, most wanted this to be ‘Most recent’ rather than ‘popular’
*	Most managers liked the idea of having ‘popular pages’ on their workspace acknowledging that this may encourage browse, but had mixed views on how these should be populated:
*	Some expected them to populate themselves based on most interacted pages
*	Others wanted to be able to populate these themselves, based on what they thought was priority content in case it got missed further up the page

## Wireframes – Save & Preview
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139666547-a70dde2f-837e-46b2-a77e-e6a74a5b9d55.png)

*	Most users responded positively to the option to ‘Save & Preview’ page ahead of publishing as they acknowledged this was a missing feature on the current platform, and would save them having to use workarounds such as ‘Test’ pages
*	One user suggested having these options available from the bottom of the template page so that they are visible after populating content in the final block
*	One user however was unsure on the purpose of a ‘Preview’ function as they felt the template itself provided a good preview of what the page would look like
*	One user questioned where the draft would save to, whether this would be a draft workspace or whether it would be accessed from somewhere in their personal profile
*	One user wanted more clarity on what would happen once they published their homepage and whether they would still be able to edit it

## Wireframes – Content Blocks – Overall
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139666607-8fb78b54-5002-4ff7-8cba-75a6a1e3261a.png)
 
*	Overall most users felt the editing process was easier & more straightforward than the existing process on Kahootz where lots of manual editing is involved
*	Most said they would be confident using a templated approach for their workspace and felt that generally the workspaces appeared more visually appealing
*	Some did raise concerns over whether this style would provide enough flexibility for their workspace, especially as not all current features such as Carousels or Events Calendars were available and it was unclear whether they could add additional blocks
*	One manager suggested the addition of a custom text and image block to allow for more creativity
*	Whilst appreciating the benefit of more uniformed workspaces from a consistency and learnability perspective, some were concerned they would miss the opportunity for creativity and every workspace would end up looking similar regardless of their members’ wants and needs
*	Some explained they could not truly understand whether this approach would work for their workspace before trying it out and understanding how they would create the content and structure behind this page

## Wireframes – Forums First
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139666647-bbf7419f-3fae-41bf-8290-85f99fbd6d79.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139666654-4f87b9e1-d750-4cdc-96ea-6b68bea217b8.png)

*	When editing the ‘Popular discussions’ block, one manager questioned what defines ‘most popular’ 
*	Because of this they were also unsure what was meant by ‘last 10 updates’ or ‘last 20 updates’, and whether these were still referring to most popular or most recent
*	One user was unsure what the options to ‘View full card’ or ‘Compact’ referred to and suggested providing a preview
*	Overall although managers felt this template worked well to provide access to their forum, they also wanted the choice to add additional features such as calendars and files. They recognised files could be accessed from the header but felt the option to add a link on the page would also be useful


## Stakeholder - Wireframes

### Wireframes – Template Response
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139666920-4a39b67e-2bc2-4504-bafc-fb61ec46c6c1.png)

*	Stakeholders explained they often get suggestions from users about being able to choose from recommended designs, so felt the templated approach was a good idea
*	There was some concern over there not being a ‘blank’ template for people to design on from scratch, though they did later recognise that the ‘Content blocks’ template could be used in this way if users were able to delete and add blocks of their choice
*	Some workspaces do not have logos or images they can use so we need to consider what happens to these sections if left blank
*	Although stakeholders did not feel anything major was missing on the templates, they still felt there may be some initial resistance to the limited options, and that an education piece on how to make best use of the features would be necessary
*	Overall stakeholders felt this was a good starting point in that it will speed up and make the process for straightforward, particularly for new managers
*	Stakeholders felt the new designs were not too ‘NHS-y’ which is important given that cross-organisation collaboration is a real opportunity for this platform

## Members - Wireframes

### Wireframes – Response to designs

- Both members preferred the Content Blocks Layout as it allowed them to see and access a variety of content
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139667038-d305a08d-1287-4afb-a7bc-468574182212.png)

*	Out of the two members we reviewed designs with
*	The first was shown the Content block and Stream/Feed template but acknowledged that whilst the Stream/Feed was a useful way to see most recent activity (a requirement for them) they would still want to be able to access other content such as Events, Webinars and Best Practice topics from this page. They also felt the stream would be too general and suggested being able to filter by topic or workstream
*	The second was shown the Forum and Content Blocks templates. Although the forum is currently their most used feature they felt the Forum first template was limiting as they also wanted to see other content and documents. They preferred the Content Blocks layout as it contained a variety of content, but suggested restrictions would need to be implemented to ensure homepages do not get too busy like on the current platform

## Wireframes – Response to designs – Quantitative Test

- 77% of members chose the ‘Content Blocks’ design due to it providing more navigational options and seeming most ‘user friendly’
  
36 members took part in the quantitative test

They were shown the four homepage design options and asked to indicate which of the layouts would best suit their need: 
*	77% chose the ‘Content blocks’
*	17% chose ‘Recent workspace activity stream’
*	3% chose ‘Documents focused’
*	3 chose ‘Forum focused’

*	Members who picked ‘Content blocks’ said that this seemed to provide the options and links they needed to navigate the workspace and seemed the most ‘user friendly’. Some likened it to current workspaces
*	Members who picked ‘Recent workspace activity stream’ explained they wanted to see recent activity when they accessed the platform, and this seemed clear and simple
