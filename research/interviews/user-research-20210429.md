# FutureNHS User Research - 29 April 2021

## Objective
The focus of this user research was to gather information on how users use the current [FutureNHS collaboration platform](https://future.nhs.uk/) with respect to:
- how they would usually get started
- their use of the group dashboard / homepage
- their use of the page builder (workspace managers only)
- their use of forums.

We also used this research to gather research on wireframes for the new FutureNHS sharing platform on the:
- initial designs of the navigation, ‘Groups’ and ‘Forums’

## Methodology
For this round of research we used a remote moderated one-to-one user research methodology. The sessions were conducted via video conference and screen sharing meeting on Teams, and participants joined from their desktop. The moderator and participant could see and hear each other in order to conduct the interview. Chat functionality allowed the moderator to provide instructions, and links to the wireframes. Participants accessed the platform & wireframes on their desktop and shared their screen. The moderator was able to see the participant’s screen and used concurrent think aloud (CTA) to understand their behaviour and asked interview questions.

## User background
We interviewed 2 platform members and 4 platform managers in total.
All participants used the platform at least twice a week (often more). 

The main use of the members were:
- document sharing
- getting updates on COVID-19 services

and for workspace managers
- sharing documents
- making connections
- sharing best practice
- managing members and forums

All users were digitally capable and used a range of tools in their work including Microsoft Teams, Jira, Google Docs, Whatsapp, Facebook, Slack etc.

## Findings on current FutureNHS Collaboration Platform

### Use of FutureNHS collaboration platform
The core use of the platform varied by workspace, and also role e.g. member or manager. Key uses of the platform were:
- An area to push new content out to an audience.
- A discussion board to collaborate on documents.
- A way of bringing together separate trusts.

Members would often take a passive role, interested in keeping up to date with forums without necessarily  contributing questions or answers.

Some members used the platform to hunt for specific content or documentation. They did this using the search function and file management structure of their workspace.

Managers generally log in in an effort to keep their workspace dashboards fresh and engaging to drive use and repeat visits. Managers with platform experience and ability would also take advantage of functionality to drive polls and surveys on their workspace to inform future design decisions.

A key function of the platform was that of a document repository for collaborative use, however with roll out of tools like SharePoint, or Teams due to Covid that use case is becoming less common.

### Thoughts on FutureNHS collaboration platform
Feedback about the platform was broadly positive though all users had areas of frustration.

#### What works well
*Members*
- Workspaces can be valuable resources for content sharing.
- Forums are a valuable resource for staying up to date.
*Managers*
- Complete control over design can be a positive as some workspaces function very differently.
- Forums are an effective way of understanding member’s concerns and frustrations without becoming directly involved.

#### Barriers & Frustrations / Improvements
*Members*
- Inconsistent page building can lead to confusion and poor usability.
- It can be hard to find new content or documents on poorly managed pages.
- The promise of the platform as a one stop collaboration and sharing hub does not match it’s reality as a cumbersome tool.
- Searching for content is difficult.
- Forum colour scheme makes it difficult to understand the hierarchy of content.
- It’s hard to understand the content of a Forum thread before diving in.

*Managers*
- Building pages is a difficult and self taught process for users who are not tech savvy and do not love design.
- Managers feel they are not utilising the workspace to it’s best potential.
- Onboarding new users is laborious, and user management even more so.
- Want to be able to surface content from forums to the workspace homepage.
- Want to be able to preview workspace changes before going live.

### Getting started on FutureNHS collaboration platform
Managers would usually get started by checking for activity on their workspace, and members would usually start on the workspace they frequent most often to check for updates.

Some users with experience of the page builder would personalise their dashboard by adding buttons to the workspaces they managed or needed to visit most often, but in the main, users did not spend much time on their personal dashboards at all.

Some users disliked the navigation structure of the Kahootz platform and to avoid using it would have their favourite workspaces bookmarked and land directly on there rather than use the platform.

Some users, use of the platform was prompted by an email notification. They would either use the link in the email to access the platform, or come to the platform separately and check the notifications section, assuming any changes would be filtered through. However some users were unsure how notifications were sent, if they were manually inputted by the manager, or automatic.

Some users would navigate to their most used workspace from the dropdown, though admitted the functionality was hard to use and shared anecdotes of new users who struggled to use it.

### Using the FutureNHS collaboration platform workspace homepages
Homepages perform different functions depending on who created them and the workspaces purpose. Homepages can function as:
- A bulletin board with the latest updates of a project or team.
- An event hub, to immediately let users know what events are incoming, and how to join.
- A social hub, with buttons leading to active discussions that have been surfaced in forums.
- A document space, to share up to date content and guidelines within teams.

**Managers** were interested in immediately knowing what interactions their board had, and if there had been any questions or queries sent to them.

**Members** wanted to see what new content had been made available, and to understand if any actions were needed from them.

**Members** also wanted to understand how active a workspace was from the dashboard.

### Using the FutureNHS collaboration platform page builder (workspace managers only)
Most users had taught themselves how to use the page builder through trial and error, they found the process frustrating and daunting with all saying they initially found the process difficult as there were no instructions, or best practice example for them to build from.

Most users were not aware of all the page building or management options available to them, as they did not have the time in their normal workday to trial and error every option and icon within the builder.

Users struggled adding images as they were unsure where they could find copywrite free images, and often the results won’t look as anticipated.

Users were frustrated by the inability to preview pages as all changes went live immediately.

Users were frustrated by the different sized widgets as they made it difficult to make the page uniform, and neat.

### Using FutureNHS collaboration platform forums
For some users forums are to core of the Kahoots experience, providing an open space to communicate and share. Managers will take care to ensure their forums are well moderated and active.

Forums are used as an “early warning system” in active workspaces to understand what members are worried about or struggling with, because of its more informal nature people are more likely to open up.

They are also used as a semi-social and collaborative space to maintain a general awareness of what other teams are doing, without needing to directly contact or set up a meeting with anybody from said teams

Forums are used as a work around to surface documents in workspaces with inexperienced managers. It’s easy to share a document in a forum, however the document can quickly become lost in a sea of posts. 

Some users treat forums as an FAQ, checking to see if their question already has a solution before posting.

## Feedback on new protoypes

### Initial impressions, design & navigation of new FutureNHS Sharing Platform

**Please note** *these are not the final designs, just early ideas to get feedback from users. We are also undertaking a separate branding exercise, so until this is complete we are reusing the existing collaboration platform's design as a placeholder*

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9471595/118097213-540f8100-b3ca-11eb-8616-1e080cbf8088.png)

Most users responded positively to the designs, feeling that it was ‘clearer’ and ‘tidy’ compared to the current Kahootz platform which appears ‘cluttered’.
Some users were initially unsure why content was duplicated across the left-hand navigation and on-page tiles, explaining there was no need to have two entry points for each section.
Some hoped to be able to customise the user dashboard to make their core groups accessible from this page and reduce clicks.
Although most users liked the use of the left-hand navigation across the site, some wondered whether it could be collapsible to maximize screen space.

*Comparison to NHS sites*

When asked how the look and feel of the site compared to their expectations of an NHS site, most said they felt the designs did a good job of still feeling corporate but not being restricted by NHS design guidelines.
There was a feeling NHS sites are often clunky and difficult to use, but this feels like it’s designed by someone who understands user requirements.

### Thoughts on new FutureNHS Sharing Platform groups

*‘Groups’ page*

Users were impressed by the ‘Groups’ page, though some were initially unsure what groups were being presented.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9471595/118098400-c16fe180-b3cb-11eb-972d-21789e116cc3.png)

Most users responded positively to the ‘Groups’ page as a way to navigate between groups.

Some users were initially unsure whether groups visible on ‘My latest groups tab’ were groups they were a member of, or just groups that had been viewed most recently.

One manager said they would ‘favourite’ their groups for easy access. They did not mention noticing the ‘Groups I’m admin of’ tab.

Users were unsure how ‘My groups’ in the navigation had been prioritised and hoped these would appear in alphabetical order or some prioritised list based on recent activity or the groups they had selected to be visible here.

Users were unsure about the term ‘Groups’ instead of workspaces, explaining it would be difficult to get used to and did not encapsulate what these are. One user thought ‘Network’ better describes their function.

*Discover a group*

Users interested in discovering new groups found this option with ease, but were unsure how tags would work to filter results.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9471595/118098585-fd0aab80-b3cb-11eb-866b-60b391aff93a.png)

Users thought it was clear how to discover new groups using either the CTA in the navigation or the tab at the top. They felt this was clearer than the current platform where the option to find a new group feels like a ‘secret’.

When looking for new groups, some were unsure how the tags would be used, whether these would be generic, or change dependent on what you typed in.

One user wanted to see how active a group was when exploring new groups, e.g. ‘X days since last post’.

*Group homepage*

Users responded positively to the group homepage and its more standardised design, but tags caused confusion

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9471595/118098974-8621e280-b3cc-11eb-8cff-52b63c6c4934.png)

Most users responded positively to the new homepage designs. They felt they were ‘clear’ and key content such as Files & Folders and Forums was easily accessible.

Users liked the idea of a more standardised format to reduce variation across workspaces, and some suggested providing ‘templates’ to support setup of the group homepage.

Few users naturally noticed or interacted with the group-specific links in the left hand nav but responded positively to these once shown.

Users did not understand the purpose of tags. Once explained, some users liked the concept of being able to link to other related content and workspaces, but explained there would have to be central control of tags to make this work.

One user wanted the option to remove tags as they were concerned they would be confusing for less tech-savvy users!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9471595/118099060-a2258400-b3cc-11eb-9fca-4ca3e2810224.png)

One user liked seeing ‘recently uploaded files’ on the homepage rather than having to show the full file structure which on the current platform can be confusing and unnecessary.

One user explained although they liked the idea of including images, they would struggle to find any related to their content (drug funds) and would be concerned about copyright, so suggested an in-built library to choose from.

There was a mixed response to related groups. Some liked the passive recommendation that may surface interesting content. Others felt this may distract from the task in hand, or wanted control over which workspaces would be recommended.

Users were able to navigate between workspaces with ease using the ‘Groups’ button in the navigation or the breadcrumb.

### Thoughts on new FutureNHS Sharing Platform forums

*Navigating to Forums*

When shown the ‘Forums’ page, some saw this as a great opportunity, others were confused as to where forums had come from.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9471595/118099181-ced99b80-b3cc-11eb-8171-5098ff3c976c.png)

Users usually navigated to forums from within a group when exploring group features. They did so with ease from either the Call to Action on page or the option in the navigation.

5 of the 6 users were then prompted to explore forums using the ‘Forums’ page in home. Responses were:
- 2 users reacted positively to the idea of having a forum-centric page to quickly access their forums and search for any questions they have across all forums.
- 3 users were confused by this page as they were unsure whether these forums belonged to groups. After the concept was explained they often saw the benefit of being able to fast-track to groups but still thought it would cause confusion.

One user hoped there would be a way to order or prioiritse which of their forums are shown initially.

One user felt the call to action ‘View group’ was confusing, as it led them to believe they would be taken to the Group homepage. Instead they suggested ‘View group forum’.

One user wanted to see ‘recommended’ forums based on their activity rather than just ‘top forums’.

*Using Forums*

Users felt the visual design of forums was clearer and simple to follow, and pulled out a number of features they liked

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9471595/118099308-f3ce0e80-b3cc-11eb-8ff7-757e52ca2346.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9471595/118099318-f7619580-b3cc-11eb-98a9-417584a840b1.png)

Initial impressions of the forum were positive as most acknowledged that it looks cleaner and simple to follow compared to the current forums on Kahootz.

In particular users responded positively to:
- (3 users) Option to search and filter by category, though users questioned how you would link a post to these
- (3 users) The visual design of threading which is logical and clear
- (2 users) ‘Likes’
- (2 users) Icons are useful to show comments, views and likes
- (2 users) Being able to follow a discussion is useful
- (1 user) The option to share and direct colleagues towards relevant discussions

Requests for improvement or additional functionality included:
- (2 users) Post understanding is dependent on title, it would be useful to show first line of the post for context
- (2 users) Make it clear how posts are ordered, with a preference to order by date posted
- (2 users) Provide access to documents and attachments
- (1 user) Ability to state as a poster if and how you wish to be contacted for follow up
- (1 user) Feeling that avatars are unnecessary once within forums
- (1 user) Uncertainty around why some responses are indented (did not understand this was a thread)

Two users were unsure about the presence of ‘related forums.’ A workspace manager felt these may distract users and a member thought, based on previous experience, these were unlikely to be relevant
