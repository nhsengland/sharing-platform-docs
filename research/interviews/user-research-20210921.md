# FutureNHS Persona Validation – 21st & 22nd September 2021

## Segmentation and Persona Work

## Objectives
*	Full understanding of user needs (not wants based on current platform) to help us identify where a collaboration platform could support
*	Identify the main problem the platform will solve for users
*	Include existing but also non-existing and hard to reach audiences, and identify who risks being excluded
*	Test new designs, brand and risky assumptions with a full range of users
*	To be able to prioritise the project roadmap against user needs as well as business needs

#### Service standards being addressed

1) Understand users and their needs
2) Solve a whole problem for users
5) Make sure everyone can use the service
10) Define what success looks like

#### A) Secondary research to form hypothesised segments

Activities may include:
*	Review of Red Badger discovery work
*	Review of brand work
*	Review of user background evidence gathered through SU research
*	Internal meetings with stakeholders
*	Review existing Kahootz workspaces and any other existing data sources to identify included and excluded groups
*	Create user segments then prioritise these to decide which we take forward into persona development

#### B) Primary research to build evidence-based personas form prioritised segments

Activities may include:
*	Initial survey or short telephone interviews to validate segments
*	Deep dive user research sessions to understand full circumstances around needs and barriers, and observe workflows and behaviours across groups
*	Analysis to build personas

#### C) Use of personas to validate work to date, test risky assumptions and update roadmap

Activities may include:
*	User research sessions with personas to observe use of and response to designs to date
*	Informal outreach for more task-bas ed feedback assessing risky assumptions or specific areas of interest
*	Update roadmap and user stories / backlog based on results

## Persona / Typologies

Research conducted:
*	5 days of desk research to review previous work & create initial user segments
*	Survey to 306 respondents to gather initial understanding of collaboration activities and attitudes, and help validate our hypothesised segments 
*	16 x deep dive 121 interviews to understand more about how individuals collaborate as part of their role both internally and externally

Analysis:
*	Analysis was completed at each stage to refine our hypothesis
*	From the survey we carried out data and thematic analysis to identify clear groupings of individuals to support our hypothesis, but also identified areas needing further exploration in deep dive sessions
*	Following the deep dives, affinity mapping and collaborative synthesis was carried out to distinguish the final persona groups. This can be found on the miro board here.

Next steps:

*	Validation research to test risky assumptions and designs to date with personas we have identified
*	Further persona research to add confidence to our groupings
*	In particular less active collaborators were under-represented in this work. We have still pulled together a persona based on the previous work we have done & the survey from this round, but would like to run further research with this group to improve our understanding

## Current Typologies

#### The collaboration explorer 
•	Drivers of collaboration between health, care & local government

#### The collaborative decision maker (local / national)
•	Senior stakeholders who are the key decision makers in collaboration practices but less involved in the day to day activities

#### The sceptical collaborator 
•	Relatively new to collaboration, so learning the ropes. Although sees the benefits, also perceived risks and challenges associated with collaboration

#### The active contributor
•	Collaboration is key and they are the 'do-er’ who contributes heavily to collaboration but doesn't have the authority to setup new collaboration practices or do the decision-making

#### The content consumer
•	Lower and mid-level bands, as well as front-line workers who collaborate predominantly in their own team. External collaboration is on the horizon, but they do not feel confident or well equipped for it, and worry that it may slow them down



## Design Validation Research

## Objective

To validate key designs produced to date against the persona segments to ensure these meet the needs of the broader user base. Creating and managing a workspace homepage (managers)
*	Groups (including latest activity, navigation, all my groups and Discover new groups)
*	Files & folders (including create a folder, upload and view a file)
*	Forums (viewing a discussion, viewing comments and adding a comment)
*	User dashboard (Understanding and navigating the dashboard)

## Methodology

For this round of research, we used a remote moderated one-to-one user research methodology. The sessions were conducted via video conference and screen sharing meeting on Teams, and participants joined from their desktop. The moderator and participant could see and hear each other in order to conduct the interview. Chat functionality allowed the moderator to provide instructions, and links to the wireframes. Participants accessed the platform & wireframes on their desktop and shared their screen. The moderator was able to see the participant’s screen and used concurrent think aloud (CTA) to understand their behaviour and asked interview questions.
User background

We interviewed 9 users:
*	1 collaborative explorer
*	3 local and 1 national collaborative decision makers
*	2 sceptical collaborators
*	2 active contributors
*	Mix of members and managers

## Summary

### Groups
*	Overall users had a good understanding of the groups section, and explained it was easier and more user friendly to manage their groups compared to the current platform
*	Some clarity was required around ‘Latest activity’ and ‘Discover new groups’ but these did not act as major barriers 
*	Most preferred the name ‘Groups’ over ‘workspaces’ as they felt this better described their purpose as collaborative networks

### Files & Folders
*	Overall users were able to navigate and add new files and folders with ease
*	Some wanted to see additional functionality such as descriptions and a search tool to aid browsing files and folders
*	Users felt there was an unnecessary screen between clicking on and previewing a file
*	Some, particularly managers expected to see additional options around editing & permissions

### Forums
*	Some were initially confused about where forums sat on the platform –within ‘groups’ or ‘forums’
*	Although able to start a new discussion with ease, some questioned the fields and options available and the order discussions appeared in
*	Users had difficulty understanding replies in a thread based on the way these appeared currently
*	Some challenged the order of comments and therefore where the option to ‘Start a new discussion’ appears

### User Dashboard
*	Most understood where they were on the platform and liked seeing personalised content brought together in one place
*	Users were initially confused by the variety of content appearing under ‘Latest activity’
*	Users struggled to understand the difference between ‘Bookmarks’ and ‘Favourites’ and questioned the need for both
*	Although some said they would use the ‘Home’ page to stay up to date, others felt browsing this would take up too much time

## Design Validation – Groups

### My Groups – Initial Understanding & Latest Activity
#### Most Users understood where they were on the platform and how to navigate to different areas within ‘My Groups’
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139684606-3ff81fe2-f6c4-4d3a-8a5a-efddaa97ba8a.png)

*	When arriving on the ‘My Groups’ page most users understood this was an area dedicated to the groups they were a member of and that the ‘Latest activity’ feed was pulling recent content from their groups
*	One user was initially unsure what they were seeing at this point. They expected to see a list of their groups on the first page, so spent some time trying to figure out what activity they were seeing
*	Users understood  they could  navigate to different areas using the tabs and had a good understanding of what ‘Favourites’, ‘All my groups’,  and  ‘Discover  New  groups’  would  include Kahootz Workspace Homepage – Creating & Editing Content

### My Groups – Latest Activity
#### Most understood the ‘Lates activity’ feed, though some were unsure what the colours related to and how they had been ordered
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139688980-1e1d727a-a1cc-46d0-86a6-ab426960436a.png)

*	Most  reacted  positively  to  the  ‘Latest  activity’  page,  explaining  it  was useful to see updates relevant to them, though two users (one ‘traditionalist’  and  one  ‘decision  maker ’) said they would be unlikely to browse this page as they felt they could get lost ‘down a rabbit hole’ so would prefer to visit their groups directly or use the direct link from their email notifications
*	Within latest activity users felt it was clear which group content was coming from and understood how they would access the group using the links highlighted
*	Users understood the type of content based on the descriptions and icons, though were often unsure what the difference in colours represented as these did not match the icons
*	Some users felt it would be more useful for the emphasis to be on the group the content is relating to rather than the member who has posted it
*	Some wanted to be able to filter or personalise the updates appearing here as they recognised it could become over whelming if they were a member of lots of groups  
*	Some commented on the fact that updates were not in order as some from 1 hour ago were appearing after updates from 3 hours ago, they said they expected these to be in chronological order

### My Groups – Favourites
#### Most liked to see a ‘Favourites’ section and had a good understanding of how this section would work
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139689053-77011206-d536-4727-8126-2c2f24399ac3.png)

*	Although unable to click on favourites, users expected this to be an area where there favourited groups would appear.  Most felt this would be a useful feature and page, allowing them quick access to their most used groups
*	Some users suggested it would be useful to be able to favourite content as well as groups in general and to be able to see this in a section within ‘favourites’ 
*	When asked most users felt it was clear how they would add groups to their favourites using the star icons.  However, one user suggested adding text next to the star icon to make this clear
*	Some users who were only a member of a small number of workspaces explained they did not think they would have enough groups to make ‘Favouriting’ worthwhile but appreciated this was a useful feature
*	One user who was a ‘Traditionalist’ explained they would not use favourites as they did not feel like they needed to narrow down their groups in this way

### My Groups – All my Groups
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139689118-8a8726ed-088c-4dbd-bc4c-01a74d3d30f5.png)

*	Users understood this was where they could access all the groups they were a member of and felt it was well presented with a good amount of preview information
*	Some were unsure on how groups had been ordered and explained they thought this should be in Alphabetical order by default or have an option to sort
*	One user felt number of members was not so relevant to them, and instead they would like to see if any of their colleagues or members in their network were members of the group
*	However, another user specifically mentioned how it would be useful to see if a group only 2 members as that had would help them gauge how active the discussion would be
*	When viewing group pages most users responded positively to the design and layout explaining it seemed straightforward to access key content using the quick links and navigational tabs at the top
*	One user explained they much preferred having their navigational options across the top rather than down the left-hand side as it currently appears on some workspaces
*	One user felt the descriptions and graphics took up too much space and they would find it frustrating having to scroll past these every time

### My Groups – All my Groups
#### Users understood they were being presented with ‘recommended’ groups an felt this was useful to help broaden their network
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139689208-b7b799de-4726-4fd5-be07-c7015a88c46b.png)

*	When arriving in ‘Discover new groups’ users understood this was where they would be able to find new groups
*	Users understood they were initially seeing ‘recommended groups’ and felt this was a useful feature as it may surface relevant groups, they’d be otherwise unaware of. They hoped these would be recommended based on the existing groups they are a member of rather than what’s popular
*	Users felt it was clear how they would request to join a group using the ‘Join group’ call to action and understood the status of their request when ‘Pending approval’ was present. They explained they would expect to click on ‘Pending approval’ to cancel the request
*	Users did not naturally interact with the ‘A-Z of groups’ as they said they would usually use the search bar if they had a specific group or topic in mind
*	Response to the ‘A-Z’  page  was  mixed,  some  felt  this  was  a  useful repositor y they could browse if they weren’t sure what they were looking for, but most felt this would be too time-consuming  to browse so they would search instead

### My Groups – All my Groups
#### Users understood they were being presented with ‘recommended’ groups and felt this was useful to help broaden their network
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139689260-e148a8a2-a660-4b7c-bf92-7de50f5a8d41.png)

*	When arriving in ‘Discover new groups’ users understood this was where they would be able to find new groups
*	Users understood they were initially seeing ‘recommended groups’ and felt this was a useful feature as it may surface relevant groups, they’d be otherwise unaware of. They hoped these would be recommended based on the existing groups they are a member of rather than what’s popular
*	Users felt it was clear how they would request to join a group using the ‘Join group’ call to action and understood the status of their request when ‘Pending approval’ was present. They explained they would expect to click on ‘Pending approval’ to cancel the request
*	Users did not naturally interact with the ‘A-Z of groups’ as they said they would usually use the search bar if they had a specific group or topic in mind
*	Response to the ‘A-Z’  page  was  mixed,  some  felt  this  was  a  useful repositor y they could browse if they weren’t sure what they were looking for, but most felt this would be too time-consuming  to browse so they would search instead

#### Most would use search when looking for a specific topic or group, but some were confused about the results or filters shown
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139689325-d496e46f-e466-4381-ab86-de44aad2062b.png)

*	Most responded positively to the search bar, particularly the way that suggestions appeared to help prompt their search
*	One user commented  on how the search bar had moved locations  at this point, explaining  they thought  this would be to reflect the fact that they would not be searching within groups rather than the entire platform, but suggested this could be confusing
*	Once reviewing the search results, most understood they were seeing a combination of content and groups and liked the fact they could filter these in and out using the tick boxes.  They referenced situations where one or the other may be useful
*	Others were confused by what they were seeing and initially missed the tick box filters. Once explained they felt this was a good option,  but the tick  boxes should appear immediately under the search bar to make them more obvious
*	Some wanted to see additional filtering and sort options here such as ‘most recent’ or ‘most commented’ especially if there are a large amount of results returned
*	One user raised concerns over content appearing in the search results. If they were a group owner, they explained they would want to be reassured that restricted content would not appear here
*	Before joining a group, some users explained they would try to click on the group hoping to see more information that would help inform their decision to join

### My Groups – Overall and ‘Groups’ language
#### Overall users felt ‘My groups’ was an improvement on the current platform and felt ‘Groups’ was more appropriate than ‘workspace.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139689594-b28b4077-1432-4e4c-a3e5-94c06372ad9b.png)

*	Overall users felt the ‘Groups’ section was a clean and easy to navigate, making it much easier and more user friendly to view and manage their groups when compared to the ‘drop-down’ on the current Kahootz platform
*	There was some general confusion around the use of colours on the platform.  Some commented on the use of purple for groups as they felt this clashed with the NHS blue. Others commented on the use of coloured stripes on groups and were unsure what these represented 
*	Most preferred the name ‘Groups’ over ‘Workspaces’ as they felt this better described their purpose, as a networking group, similar to a group on social media. They felt ‘workspaces’ were more formal and had negative connotations with ‘extra work’

## Stakeholder – Kahootz Workspace Homepages
### Stakeholders shared the real variety of workspace homepage designs due to flexibility on the current platform, through acknowledged this creates challenges
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139689744-129c6c7d-496b-47ec-8c86-e931ada9277c.png)

*	Stakeholders informed us that there is a real variety of use cases for workspaces homepages. This is possibly due to the flexibility and ‘free reign’ that managers have at the moment
*	Whilst the flexibility is great in allowing workspaces to best suit the needs of their members, it also creates challenges:
*	Managers do not always have a technical or design background making homepage creation challenging and requiring additional support & training
*	Currently too much choice and little clarity on what different features should be used for leads to incorrect use of features
*	Because the platform is free, many will use it despite it not necessarily being the correct solution for their needs
*	Stakeholders saw the need for a ‘flexible template’ providing a framework to build within but with some flexibility

## Members – Kahootz – Getting Started & Workspace Homepage

### Kahootz – Getting Started * Workspace Homepage
#### Members use of workspace homepages was limited as they were usually directed to updates or content from email notifications
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139689825-771f4860-3c0e-4515-8531-a475439ed2d8.png)

*	Members did not naturally engage with the workspace homepage when getting started or accessing the platform. They explained they usually accessed content directly form an email notification
*	If for any reason they wanted to revisit something or find specific content, they may come to the homepage to do this but explained this was very rare and they may just use the search function instead
*	One member explained their interaction was mostly with the discussion forum and that this was typically used to signpost & direct members to relevant content on the workspace
*	When asked to review their workspace homepage, one user felt this was very ‘busy’ and contained lots of sections and information not relevant to them, making it difficult to figure out where they should go 

## Managers - Wireframes

### Wireframes – Choosing a template
#### Most understood they must choose a template to proceed, though some wanted additional examples or explanations to help them choose
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139712491-6d8a0c32-9847-48fa-ad2e-bc9906c2d644.png)

*	Most managers understood what they were required to do at this point, and got started by reviewing the options and deciding which would be most appropriate for them
*	Although most responded positively to creating a homepage via templates, some were initially resistant, explaining workspaces were customised and ‘don’t fit into boxes’
*	One user did not initially realise they had to choose one of these, and thought they were ‘Blocks’ of which they could choose multiple to build the page. They felt the description should be more specific to help them understand what they needed to do
*	Some had difficulty making a decision based on the icons and descriptions alone and suggested adding preview images to help them choose the most appropriate
*	Managers wanted to understand how rigid these templates were and whether they would be able to still add other types of content, especially if later down the line the scope of their workspace changed. They were afraid they may have to start again from scratch

#### 5 out of & managers would choose the ‘Content Block’ template due to flexibility
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139712569-a3122f62-5985-4b9c-afe8-8df6af507f84.png)

*	Out of the 7 managers who saw the template options, 5 opted for the ‘Content blocks options’ due to the perceived flexibility allowing them to include different types of content, and many explaining this seemed similar to the current setup on Kahootz
*	2 managers chose the forums first approach as the forum was the most used area of their workspace
*	Some with smaller or newer workspaces explained they would not choose the Stream/Feed or Discussion first templates as there was not enough activity on their workspace

### Wireframes – Choosing a template – Quantitative Test
#### 61% of managers chose the ‘Content blocks’ template due to more flexibility and opportunities to customise
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139712624-44763ec2-2591-4fba-95f6-3beaa3f83b7d.png)

#### 28 managers took part in the quantitative test
Before seeing the template options, users were asked ‘When you create a workspace, which of the following apply to you?’
*	61% answered ‘I'd prefer to choose between some ready-made templates’
*	29% answered ‘I enjoy designing a workspace from scratch’
*	11% answered ‘I'd like the platform to generate a standard template for me’

When presented with the four template options: 
*	61% chose the ‘Content blocks’
*	7% chose ‘Stream / feed; 
*	7% chose ‘Documents first’
*	4% chose ‘Forum first’

Those who picked content blocks said this was due to it providing more flexibility and opportunities to customise content and design
*	93% said they were ‘Very confident’ or ‘Somewhat confident’ with their choice

### Wireframes – Content blocks – editing the page
#### Managers understood how to get started editing the page, but wanted further clarity on functionality and options
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139712782-52f633b5-0b93-4d8b-8d93-da64eea03ad8.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139712790-94d710cb-9525-45ef-aac1-d8a168918a23.png)

*	Most users got started editing their page with ease and felt it was clear how they would get started editing or deleting blocks
*	Some initially missed the header block at the top of the page, explaining they assumed all editable content sat below the calls to action ‘Save draft’ and ‘Save and preview page’.
*	A number of managers wanted to be able to move blocks around with some explaining that the ‘Key links’ were something they would want at the top, or a need to spotlight any key updates
*	When editing the header block, some questioned whether there was a word limit for the descriptions and felt this should be specified
*	A number of users were unsure what the options to ‘Include a forum page’, ‘…files page’, ‘…members page’ were for, explaining there should be a tooltip or contextual help to explain these 
*	Once realising what these were, some users commented it was confusing to be asked to add these before creating any kind of site structure and questioned at what point they would do this
*	However most responded positively to the option to add these to the header explaining these were key areas and provides a clear entry point

#### Managers liked the Introduction block, but questioned how it would appear & there was a mixed respond to the Group Summary
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139713077-89f971eb-9167-4d6a-9153-7bd0ee92db40.png)

*	In the Group Introduction block, users liked the fact the image was formatted for them as many had had difficulty formatting pictures on Kahootz.
*	Some questioned whether the introduction block would need to appear consistently, and suggested a hide function to maximise screen space for familiar members
*	There was a mixed response to the group summary as whilst some said this was useful to see, those particularly with less active groups said they would may not want this visible to all members and instead would want it for auditing purposes only
*	When adding ‘Essential links’ users liked the option to add icons but hoped there would be a library to choose from for ease and consistency. 
*	Some were also unsure whether they could link to external pages as internal pages and explained they hope they would be able to

#### Some wanted to see ‘Most recent’ rather then ‘Popular’ discussions, and there were mixed views on how popular pages should be populated
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139713162-9e51406c-c305-469d-bf8b-32427db7dac7.png)

*	Although most liked being able to see a preview of discussions under ‘Popular Discussions’ which wasn’t available on the current platform, most wanted this to be ‘Most recent’ rather than ‘popular’
*	Most managers liked the idea of having ‘popular pages’ on their workspace acknowledging that this may encourage browse, but had mixed views on how these should be populated:
*	Some expected them to populate themselves based on most interacted pages
*	Others wanted to be able to populate these themselves, based on what they thought was priority content in case it got missed further up the page

### Wireframes – Save & Preview
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139713221-ec9b38d2-2369-47df-9e8b-7a7a28d17e9b.png)
  
*	Most users responded positively to the option to ‘Save & Preview’ page ahead of publishing as they acknowledged this was a missing feature on the current platform, and would save them having to use workarounds such as ‘Test’ pages
*	One user suggested having these options available from the bottom of the template page so that they are visible after populating content in the final block
*	One user however was unsure on the purpose of a ‘Preview’ function as they felt the template itself provided a good preview of what the page would look like
*	One user questioned where the draft would save to, whether this would be a draft workspace or whether it would be accessed from somewhere in their personal profile
*	One user wanted more clarity on what would happen once they published their homepage and whether they would still be able to edit it

### Wireframes – Content Blocks – Overall
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139713262-ff0c1d52-76d8-4ca3-8a9b-dd53a72344a7.png)

*	Overall most users felt the editing process was easier & more straightforward than the existing process on Kahootz where lots of manual editing is involved
*	Most said they would be confident using a templated approach for their workspace and felt that generally the workspaces appeared more visually appealing
*	Some did raise concerns over whether this style would provide enough flexibility for their workspace, especially as not all current features such as Carousels or Events Calendars were available and it was unclear whether they could add additional blocks
*	One manager suggested the addition of a custom text and image block to allow for more creativity
*	Whilst appreciating the benefit of more uniformed workspaces from a consistency and learnability perspective, some were concerned they would miss the opportunity for creativity and every workspace would end up looking similar regardless of their members’ wants and needs
*	Some explained they could not truly understand whether this approach would work for their workspace before trying it out and understanding how they would create the content and structure behind this page

### Wireframes – Forums First
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139713308-d900ea34-0238-4b2e-8050-76350c3123ef.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139713314-ab0b7aa2-ac32-4b79-b979-cccd613b6a6c.png)

*	When editing the ‘Popular discussions’ block, one manager questioned what defines ‘most popular’ 
*	Because of this they were also unsure what was meant by ‘last 10 updates’ or ‘last 20 updates’, and whether these were still referring to most popular or most recent
*	One user was unsure what the options to ‘View full card’ or ‘Compact’ referred to and suggested providing a preview
*	Overall although managers felt this template worked well to provide access to their forum, they also wanted the choice to add additional features such as calendars and files. They recognised files could be accessed from the header but felt the option to add a link on the page would also be useful

### Stakeholder - Wireframes
#### Wireframes – Template Response
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139713473-796889f2-9ca1-4e9b-8b8d-53d1cd7d0cb8.png)

*	Stakeholders explained they often get suggestions from users about being able to choose from recommended designs, so felt the templated approach was a good idea
*	There was some concern over there not being a ‘blank’ template for people to design on from scratch, though they did later recognise that the ‘Content blocks’ template could be used in this way if users were able to delete and add blocks of their choice
*	Some workspaces do not have logos or images they can use so we need to consider what happens to these sections if left blank
*	Although stakeholders did not feel anything major was missing on the templates, they still felt there may be some initial resistance to the limited options, and that an education piece on how to make best use of the features would be necessary
*	Overall stakeholders felt this was a good starting point in that it will speed up and make the process for straightforward, particularly for new managers
*	Stakeholders felt the new designs were not too ‘NHS-y’ which is important given that cross-organisation collaboration is a real opportunity for this platform

## Members - Wireframes

### Wireframes – Response to designs
#### Both members preferred the Content Blocks Layout as it allowed them to see and access a variety of content
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139713634-64f969c8-82a7-4590-baa3-e6c338be9921.png)
  
*	Out of the two members we reviewed designs with
*	The first was shown the Content block and Stream/Feed template but acknowledged that whilst the Stream/Feed was a useful way to see most recent activity (a requirement for them) they would still want to be able to access other content such as Events, Webinars and Best Practice topics from this page. They also felt the stream would be too general and suggested being able to filter by topic or workstream
*	The second was shown the Forum and Content Blocks templates. Although the forum is currently their most used feature they felt the Forum first template was limiting as they also wanted to see other content and documents. They preferred the Content Blocks layout as it contained a variety of content, but suggested restrictions would need to be implemented to ensure homepages do not get too busy like on the current platform

### Wireframes – Response to designs – Quantitative Test
#### 77% of members chose the ‘Content Blocks’ design due to it providing more navigational options and seeming most ‘user friendly’
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139713692-f69b8954-cfff-4d30-863e-6fd3a3338c13.png)

*	36 members took part in the quantitative test
*	They were shown the four homepage design options and asked to indicate which of the layouts would best suit their need: 
*	77% chose the ‘Content blocks’
*	17% chose ‘Recent workspace activity stream’
