# FutureNHS Persona Validation – 21st & 22nd September 2021

## Segmentation and Persona Work

## Objectives
*	Full understanding of user needs (not wants based on current platform) to help us identify where a collaboration platform could support
*	Identify the main problem the platform will solve for users
*	Include existing but also non-existing and hard to reach audiences, and identify who risks being excluded
*	Test new designs, brand and risky assumptions with a full range of users
*	To be able to prioritise the project roadmap against user needs as well as business needs

#### Service standards being addressed

1) Understand users and their needs
2) Solve a whole problem for users
5) Make sure everyone can use the service
10) Define what success looks like

#### A) Secondary research to form hypothesised segments

Activities may include:
*	Review of Red Badger discovery work
*	Review of brand work
*	Review of user background evidence gathered through SU research
*	Internal meetings with stakeholders
*	Review existing Kahootz workspaces and any other existing data sources to identify included and excluded groups
*	Create user segments then prioritise these to decide which we take forward into persona development

#### B) Primary research to build evidence-based personas form prioritised segments

Activities may include:
*	Initial survey or short telephone interviews to validate segments
*	Deep dive user research sessions to understand full circumstances around needs and barriers, and observe workflows and behaviours across groups
*	Analysis to build personas

#### C) Use of personas to validate work to date, test risky assumptions and update roadmap

Activities may include:
*	User research sessions with personas to observe use of and response to designs to date
*	Informal outreach for more task-bas ed feedback assessing risky assumptions or specific areas of interest
*	Update roadmap and user stories / backlog based on results

## Persona / Typologies

Research conducted:
*	5 days of desk research to review previous work & create initial user segments
*	Survey to 306 respondents to gather initial understanding of collaboration activities and attitudes, and help validate our hypothesised segments 
*	16 x deep dive 121 interviews to understand more about how individuals collaborate as part of their role both internally and externally

Analysis:
*	Analysis was completed at each stage to refine our hypothesis
*	From the survey we carried out data and thematic analysis to identify clear groupings of individuals to support our hypothesis, but also identified areas needing further exploration in deep dive sessions
*	Following the deep dives, affinity mapping and collaborative synthesis was carried out to distinguish the final persona groups. This can be found on the miro board here.

Next steps:

*	Validation research to test risky assumptions and designs to date with personas we have identified
*	Further persona research to add confidence to our groupings
*	In particular less active collaborators were under-represented in this work. We have still pulled together a persona based on the previous work we have done & the survey from this round, but would like to run further research with this group to improve our understanding

## Current Typologies

#### The collaboration explorer 
•	Drivers of collaboration between health, care & local government

#### The collaborative decision maker (local / national)
•	Senior stakeholders who are the key decision makers in collaboration practices but less involved in the day to day activities

#### The sceptical collaborator 
•	Relatively new to collaboration, so learning the ropes. Although sees the benefits, also perceived risks and challenges associated with collaboration

#### The active contributor
•	Collaboration is key and they are the 'do-er’ who contributes heavily to collaboration but doesn't have the authority to setup new collaboration practices or do the decision-making

#### The content consumer
•	Lower and mid-level bands, as well as front-line workers who collaborate predominantly in their own team. External collaboration is on the horizon, but they do not feel confident or well equipped for it, and worry that it may slow them down



## Design Validation Research

## Objective

To validate key designs produced to date against the persona segments to ensure these meet the needs of the broader user base. Creating and managing a workspace homepage (managers)
*	Groups (including latest activity, navigation, all my groups and Discover new groups)
*	Files & folders (including create a folder, upload and view a file)
*	Forums (viewing a discussion, viewing comments and adding a comment)
*	User dashboard (Understanding and navigating the dashboard)

## Methodology

For this round of research, we used a remote moderated one-to-one user research methodology. The sessions were conducted via video conference and screen sharing meeting on Teams, and participants joined from their desktop. The moderator and participant could see and hear each other in order to conduct the interview. Chat functionality allowed the moderator to provide instructions, and links to the wireframes. Participants accessed the platform & wireframes on their desktop and shared their screen. The moderator was able to see the participant’s screen and used concurrent think aloud (CTA) to understand their behaviour and asked interview questions.
User background

We interviewed 9 users:
*	1 collaborative explorer
*	3 local and 1 national collaborative decision makers
*	2 sceptical collaborators
*	2 active contributors
*	Mix of members and managers

## Summary

### Groups
*	Overall users had a good understanding of the groups section, and explained it was easier and more user friendly to manage their groups compared to the current platform
*	Some clarity was required around ‘Latest activity’ and ‘Discover new groups’ but these did not act as major barriers 
*	Most preferred the name ‘Groups’ over ‘workspaces’ as they felt this better described their purpose as collaborative networks

### Files & Folders
*	Overall users were able to navigate and add new files and folders with ease
*	Some wanted to see additional functionality such as descriptions and a search tool to aid browsing files and folders
*	Users felt there was an unnecessary screen between clicking on and previewing a file
*	Some, particularly managers expected to see additional options around editing & permissions

### Forums
*	Some were initially confused about where forums sat on the platform –within ‘groups’ or ‘forums’
*	Although able to start a new discussion with ease, some questioned the fields and options available and the order discussions appeared in
*	Users had difficulty understanding replies in a thread based on the way these appeared currently
*	Some challenged the order of comments and therefore where the option to ‘Start a new discussion’ appears

### User Dashboard
*	Most understood where they were on the platform and liked seeing personalised content brought together in one place
*	Users were initially confused by the variety of content appearing under ‘Latest activity’
*	Users struggled to understand the difference between ‘Bookmarks’ and ‘Favourites’ and questioned the need for both
*	Although some said they would use the ‘Home’ page to stay up to date, others felt browsing this would take up too much time

## Design Validation – Groups

### My Groups – Initial Understanding & Latest Activity
#### Most Users understood where they were on the platform and how to navigate to different areas within ‘My Groups’
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139684606-3ff81fe2-f6c4-4d3a-8a5a-efddaa97ba8a.png)

*	When arriving on the ‘My Groups’ page most users understood this was an area dedicated to the groups they were a member of and that the ‘Latest activity’ feed was pulling recent content from their groups
*	One user was initially unsure what they were seeing at this point. They expected to see a list of their groups on the first page, so spent some time trying to figure out what activity they were seeing
*	Users understood  they could  navigate to different areas using the tabs and had a good understanding of what ‘Favourites’, ‘All my groups’,  and  ‘Discover  New  groups’  would  include Kahootz Workspace Homepage – Creating & Editing Content

### My Groups – Latest Activity
#### Most understood the ‘Lates activity’ feed, though some were unsure what the colours related to and how they had been ordered
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139688980-1e1d727a-a1cc-46d0-86a6-ab426960436a.png)

*	Most  reacted  positively  to  the  ‘Latest  activity’  page,  explaining  it  was useful to see updates relevant to them, though two users (one ‘traditionalist’  and  one  ‘decision  maker ’) said they would be unlikely to browse this page as they felt they could get lost ‘down a rabbit hole’ so would prefer to visit their groups directly or use the direct link from their email notifications
*	Within latest activity users felt it was clear which group content was coming from and understood how they would access the group using the links highlighted
*	Users understood the type of content based on the descriptions and icons, though were often unsure what the difference in colours represented as these did not match the icons
*	Some users felt it would be more useful for the emphasis to be on the group the content is relating to rather than the member who has posted it
*	Some wanted to be able to filter or personalise the updates appearing here as they recognised it could become over whelming if they were a member of lots of groups  
*	Some commented on the fact that updates were not in order as some from 1 hour ago were appearing after updates from 3 hours ago, they said they expected these to be in chronological order

### My Groups – Favourites
#### Most liked to see a ‘Favourites’ section and had a good understanding of how this section would work
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139689053-77011206-d536-4727-8126-2c2f24399ac3.png)

*	Although unable to click on favourites, users expected this to be an area where there favourited groups would appear.  Most felt this would be a useful feature and page, allowing them quick access to their most used groups
*	Some users suggested it would be useful to be able to favourite content as well as groups in general and to be able to see this in a section within ‘favourites’ 
*	When asked most users felt it was clear how they would add groups to their favourites using the star icons.  However, one user suggested adding text next to the star icon to make this clear
*	Some users who were only a member of a small number of workspaces explained they did not think they would have enough groups to make ‘Favouriting’ worthwhile but appreciated this was a useful feature
*	One user who was a ‘Traditionalist’ explained they would not use favourites as they did not feel like they needed to narrow down their groups in this way

### My Groups – All my Groups
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139689118-8a8726ed-088c-4dbd-bc4c-01a74d3d30f5.png)

*	Users understood this was where they could access all the groups they were a member of and felt it was well presented with a good amount of preview information
*	Some were unsure on how groups had been ordered and explained they thought this should be in Alphabetical order by default or have an option to sort
*	One user felt number of members was not so relevant to them, and instead they would like to see if any of their colleagues or members in their network were members of the group
*	However, another user specifically mentioned how it would be useful to see if a group only 2 members as that had would help them gauge how active the discussion would be
*	When viewing group pages most users responded positively to the design and layout explaining it seemed straightforward to access key content using the quick links and navigational tabs at the top
*	One user explained they much preferred having their navigational options across the top rather than down the left-hand side as it currently appears on some workspaces
*	One user felt the descriptions and graphics took up too much space and they would find it frustrating having to scroll past these every time

### My Groups – All my Groups
#### Users understood they were being presented with ‘recommended’ groups an felt this was useful to help broaden their network
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139689208-b7b799de-4726-4fd5-be07-c7015a88c46b.png)

*	When arriving in ‘Discover new groups’ users understood this was where they would be able to find new groups
*	Users understood they were initially seeing ‘recommended groups’ and felt this was a useful feature as it may surface relevant groups, they’d be otherwise unaware of. They hoped these would be recommended based on the existing groups they are a member of rather than what’s popular
*	Users felt it was clear how they would request to join a group using the ‘Join group’ call to action and understood the status of their request when ‘Pending approval’ was present. They explained they would expect to click on ‘Pending approval’ to cancel the request
*	Users did not naturally interact with the ‘A-Z of groups’ as they said they would usually use the search bar if they had a specific group or topic in mind
*	Response to the ‘A-Z’  page  was  mixed,  some  felt  this  was  a  useful repositor y they could browse if they weren’t sure what they were looking for, but most felt this would be too time-consuming  to browse so they would search instead

### My Groups – All my Groups
#### Users understood they were being presented with ‘recommended’ groups and felt this was useful to help broaden their network
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139689260-e148a8a2-a660-4b7c-bf92-7de50f5a8d41.png)

*	When arriving in ‘Discover new groups’ users understood this was where they would be able to find new groups
*	Users understood they were initially seeing ‘recommended groups’ and felt this was a useful feature as it may surface relevant groups, they’d be otherwise unaware of. They hoped these would be recommended based on the existing groups they are a member of rather than what’s popular
*	Users felt it was clear how they would request to join a group using the ‘Join group’ call to action and understood the status of their request when ‘Pending approval’ was present. They explained they would expect to click on ‘Pending approval’ to cancel the request
*	Users did not naturally interact with the ‘A-Z of groups’ as they said they would usually use the search bar if they had a specific group or topic in mind
*	Response to the ‘A-Z’  page  was  mixed,  some  felt  this  was  a  useful repositor y they could browse if they weren’t sure what they were looking for, but most felt this would be too time-consuming  to browse so they would search instead

#### Most would use search when looking for a specific topic or group, but some were confused about the results or filters shown
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139689325-d496e46f-e466-4381-ab86-de44aad2062b.png)

*	Most responded positively to the search bar, particularly the way that suggestions appeared to help prompt their search
*	One user commented  on how the search bar had moved locations  at this point, explaining  they thought  this would be to reflect the fact that they would not be searching within groups rather than the entire platform, but suggested this could be confusing
*	Once reviewing the search results, most understood they were seeing a combination of content and groups and liked the fact they could filter these in and out using the tick boxes.  They referenced situations where one or the other may be useful
*	Others were confused by what they were seeing and initially missed the tick box filters. Once explained they felt this was a good option,  but the tick  boxes should appear immediately under the search bar to make them more obvious
*	Some wanted to see additional filtering and sort options here such as ‘most recent’ or ‘most commented’ especially if there are a large amount of results returned
*	One user raised concerns over content appearing in the search results. If they were a group owner, they explained they would want to be reassured that restricted content would not appear here
*	Before joining a group, some users explained they would try to click on the group hoping to see more information that would help inform their decision to join

### My Groups – Overall and ‘Groups’ language
#### Overall users felt ‘My groups’ was an improvement on the current platform and felt ‘Groups’ was more appropriate than ‘workspace.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/139689594-b28b4077-1432-4e4c-a3e5-94c06372ad9b.png)

*	Overall users felt the ‘Groups’ section was a clean and easy to navigate, making it much easier and more user friendly to view and manage their groups when compared to the ‘drop-down’ on the current Kahootz platform
*	There was some general confusion around the use of colours on the platform.  Some commented on the use of purple for groups as they felt this clashed with the NHS blue. Others commented on the use of coloured stripes on groups and were unsure what these represented 
*	Most preferred the name ‘Groups’ over ‘Workspaces’ as they felt this better described their purpose, as a networking group, similar to a group on social media. They felt ‘workspaces’ were more formal and had negative connotations with ‘extra work’

### Files & Folders - Initial Impressions & Add folder
#### Users thought the section appeared as they expected and understood how to get started acessing existing or adding new folders
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/141293527-7358387c-fa87-4d6a-ac58-2013783890a4.png)

* Most users reacted positively to the ‘Files’ section. They understood they would have accessed this from the ‘Files’ tab within the group navigation and explained it looked as they expected with a clear design & layout
* Users were quickly drawn to ‘Add folder’ explaining it was clear how they would begin adding a new folder
* Users responded positively to the error validation, explaining this was clear and liked that it provided a link to the error itself, saving any confusion on longer forms in particular
* One user expected to see at least a preview of their ‘description’ appearing in the list of folders to help distinguish between folders
* Some were surprised that there did not seem to be the option to add folders within folders. Although some said this may be ok as it would encourage them to create better folder structures, others felt this functionality was important to create sub areas for their workspace

### Files & Folders - Adding & Viewing Files
#### Users were able to upload a file with ease but wanted to see additional detail and functionality when viewing files in a folder
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/141293696-2091000c-6b01-4596-8684-492abfa66b34.png)

* Users felt it was clear and straightforward to upload a file
* One user wanted to be able to ‘drag and drop’ a file in as they said thy found this easier than having to locate it in their File Explorer
* Some wanted to be able to see ‘Modified date’ as well as uploaded to be able to keep track of activity on files
* Again some thought it would be useful to see the file description in the table on the folder page to help distinguish between documents
* To navigate files, some expected to be able to ‘search’ or ‘sort’ by clicking on the ‘Name’ and ‘Uploaded date’ headings to reorder items in a similar way to File Explorer.
* Some suggested adding pagination when files exceed a certain number as this is easier to browse than a long list of files
* One manager explained that being able to display files in a grid rather than a list had worked well to aid navigation on their current workspace and they would like to see a similar option here

### Files & folders –Adding & viewing files
#### Users felt there was an unnecessary step when viewing files and expected to see additional versioning options to support collaboration
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/141293863-99964afe-d83c-4ff5-b27d-08d8ddcbc025.png)

* When going to view a file, users clicked on one of the name links, but explained they thought this would take them directly to the file preview so were surprised when this took them to the File Description page. Some said this felt like an unnecessary extra step
* Some had hoped to be able to be able to edit and collaborate on documents within the document viewer so were disappointed when this did not seem to be an option. They understood they must download a document to make changes instead but worried this would create versioning issues and discourage collaboration
* Some users stressed the importance of versioned documents on the current platform but explained they were unsure how this would work in the new designs. They suggested listing the number of versions on the preview page and then providing access to older versions on the File description page
* Users did not usually notice the in-page link to return them to the folder, instead using the main breadcrumb or browser back button. They felt this may be more obvious if more levels were shown and they had named the folder themselves

### Files & folders – Overall
#### Overall users felt that adding and viewing files and folders was straightforward but expected to see additional options around editing & permissions
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/141294130-8ffdc09c-f89b-4033-9df6-0bc7240b016c.png)

* There was some concern that permissions had not been considered in the new designs. When creating folders and uploading files, some users explained they would like to see options to restrict access, particularly when dealing with sensitive content
* One user who was an existing workspace manager said they would like to see further options around files and folders such as the option to move a file, edit its title or delete it

## Design Validation - Forums

### Forums –understanding & initial impressions
#### Some were initially unsure where they were on the platform, but felt the forum page appeared clear and familiar
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/141294330-e7efe58f-123b-4f44-a379-4f8e355e6a7d.png)

* When arriving on the Forums page, some were unsure where abouts they were on the platform. Most were able to work this out using the breadcrumb but this raised confusion as to whether forums always sat within a group or within the Forums tab in the main left-hand navigation
* One user explained the layout and design seemed familiar because it looks similar to social media, though explained this also concerned them as they worried it could lead to more relaxed and unprofessional conversations
* Users felt the ‘Latest discussion’ page was clear and understood they could either choose a discussion to view it or start a new discussion

### Forums –start a new discussion 
#### Users understood how to start a new discussion but questioned some of the fields and options
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/141294426-373e12d2-af95-4083-ae0f-768219364449.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/141294434-bfe03a8a-a6b1-4fcc-88e3-2b4a5e02e286.png)

* When starting a new discussion, users were confused by the field ‘Label text goes here’ as they expected this to say ‘Title’
* One user explained that duplicate discussions are a problem on the current platform so it would be useful if there was logic built-in to flag if any posts with a similar title already exist
* Users liked the option to ‘Pin discussion’ but explained they expected this to just pin it for them rather than the all members. They felt it would defeat the point of pinning if everyone pinned their own posts
* One user suggested that only workspace managers should be able to pin posts to ensure the feature is used effectively
* One user spoke about being able to ‘Pin a discussion to a topic’ explaining that they would like to be able attach or ‘tag’ new discussions against a subject area
* Users were unsure on the order discussions appeared in as these did not seem to be chronological. They expected to have the option to sort in a way that was most meaningful to them such as most recent or most liked

### Forums –viewing a discussion post
#### There was some confusion around the order in which comments appeared and the way replies are presented in a thread
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/141294585-215d7cc8-d0fa-4077-bcee-261e4f6e6903.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/141294594-30593639-473e-4137-ab2b-7315911c14c5.png)

* There was a mixed response to the order that comments appeared when viewing a discussion post. Some were happy with the current order where most recent appeared at the bottom, others expected new comments to be added to the top so were confused when trying to read through and understand comments
* The way threaded comments appeared caused confusion for users. Based on the indentation and additional blue line, users felt it was clear when it was a reply to a comment rather than a new comment. However they did not usually understand when it was a reply to a reply. This appeared no different visually, and users said they would expect this to be indented further to distinguish a reply vs a reply to a reply
* Users thought it was clear how they would like and reply to comments themselves
* When asked to add a new comment, some users were drawn to the bottom of the page explaining this is where they expected to find a comment field. However others expected this at the top instead or to be a floating button they could use no matter where on the page they were
* Users liked the options to format their comment, though one user suggested also having the option to reply privately as they may not always want to ask a question or respond publicly

### Forums –overall
#### Overall users felt the designs were more user friendly and easier to navigate compared to the current platform
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/141294684-d5afa07f-f177-4762-aac0-364400e2da71.png)

* Overall users commented that the new forum designs seemed user friendly and easier to navigate compared to the current Kahootz platform

## Design Validation - User Dashboard

### User dashboard –initial impressions & favourites
#### Most understood they were on the ‘Home’ page and liked to see a page personalised to their activity
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/141294824-39b8a7b7-5d0d-4c14-83a2-fdc647ee1bca.png)

* Most users had a good understanding of where they were on the platform when arriving on this page and described it as their ‘homepage’
* Users liked how this page seemed to be personalised to their own groups and activity, explaining this seemed to be much better than the current platform as it brings everything into one place
* Most liked to see favouritesat the top of the page and after reviewing these and the icons, realisedthese included multiple content types not just groups they had favourited.
* One user also wanted to be able to favourite files not just folders
* One user suggested grouping favourites so that groups appear together, discussions appear together etc.

### User dashboard –‘Here’s what’s happening’
#### Most were unsure what content was showing under ‘Recent activity’ and felt ‘Discover groups’ was a duplication od the groups section
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/141294961-fec4b321-db7f-47a6-a36b-d2cf6a3a2069.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/141294965-1d494fcb-6825-49a2-a167-c5863bb1adb0.png)

* Under recent activity users understood this was a list of latest activity on the platform but were initially unsure where this was coming from. Some thought it was a combination of updates relevant to them and then more generic activity from groups they were not necessarily a member of
* Until pointed out, most users did not realisethis feed was showing a combination of group updates and personal notifcations. Users suggested this could get overwhelming and were often unsure how it was different to ‘Latest activity’ on the group homepage, so suggested limiting ‘Recent activity’ to notifications and updates directly relevant to them (e.g. content they were following)
* Users liked to see ‘Recommended groups’ within ‘Discover groups’ though some felt this duplicated the ‘Discover New Groups’ section within groups so challenged the need for both
* Some commented that they preferred the grid layout of this version as it was more visual than the list in ‘Groups’
* Although they could not click to view ‘Recommended content’ users expected this to be similar to ‘Recommended groups’ but content specific based on content they currently interacted with
* Some were unsure whether this would include content from groups they are a member of or not. To add value they felt this would have to include content from groups they were not a member of, but acknowledged this may be complicated by permissions

### User dashboard –‘Here’s what’s happening’ – Bookmarks
#### Users were initially confused by Bookmarks and were unsure how these would be different to favourites
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/141295096-b43c625f-dd94-4f11-95aa-da5cb5ef4520.png)

* Most users were initially confused by ‘Bookmarks’ and struggled to understand how these would be different to Favourites. They felt just one or the other was necessary
* Some users thought Bookmarks may be related to what the had ‘pinned’ having seen this functionality in the Forums area
* One user initially likened Bookmarks to a ‘Follow’ feature or the option to ‘subscribe’ to a discussion similar to the current platform
* Once reviewing Bookmarks, some understood this as a ‘Save for Later’ feature for specific pages or pieces of content, and said they thought this was useful to have as well as favourites
* Some suggested changing the name to ‘Saved links’ to distinguish between this and favourites
* Users were unsure how they would add bookmarks, as they only recalled seeing a star icon on content throughout the platform

### User dashboard – Overall
#### Although most responded positively to ‘Home’ as a central place to view content, others felt they would not get the time to use this
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/141295177-aa12c628-5f20-4cdf-b6a7-351627f4cb3d.png)
 
* Most users responded positively to the ‘Home’ page explaining it was easy to use and they would be likely to use this as a central place to get updates from the platform
* Some said they may use this daily as a way to keep an eye on activity as they do their morning sweep of emails etc.
* However some users, particularly the ‘Collaborative decision makers’ and ‘Scepticalcollaborators’ said realistically they are too busy to ‘browse’ the platform in this way and would still need a prompt to visit the platform. They felt they would be more likely to access the platform from email updates instead
* Some felt the Home page appeared functional and could benefit from a graphic or picture to make it more visual
