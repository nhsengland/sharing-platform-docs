# FutureNHS Permissions – 24th - 26th November 2021

## Permissions

- Use of workspace permissions​
- Use of teams and member permissions​
- Use of content permissions​

## Methodology

For this round of research we used a remote moderated one-to-one user research methodology. The sessions were conducted via video conference and screen sharing meeting on Teams, and participants joined from their desktop. The moderator and participant could see and hear each other in order to conduct the interview. Chat functionality allowed the moderator to provide instructions, and links to the wireframes. Participants accessed the platform & wireframes on their desktop and shared their screen. The moderator was able to see the participant’s screen and used concurrent think aloud (CTA) to understand their behaviour and asked interview questions.

## Summary

### Workspace Permissions

- Out of the 6 key account workspaces discussed, 2 were very large ‘Open’ workspaces designed to encourage collaboration, though still contained restricted folders or ‘subspaces’
- All other workspaces were set to ‘Private’ to control membership, though some questioned whether this was still necessary
- Registration to the platform itself was seen as a greater barrier to access than workspace permissions and many regularly had to support members with this process

### Members & Teams

- All 6 workspaces discussed in detail had setup teams to restrict content to a specific audience or region which were then assigned to a ‘subspace’ of content​
- Managers experienced difficulties setting and managing teams due to the lacking functionality and poor usability. For example, the inability to create ‘roles’, as well as difficulty navigating settings and assigning the correct individuals to the correct teams​

### Content Permissions

- Most used these to set content to ‘View’ only for members and then ‘Modify’ & ‘Create’ for managers and teams
- Although the options were considered appropriate the steps to set these were considered tedious. In particular, the way permissions are automatically assigned from a parent to a child, and how teams and content have to created separately and then applied to one another creating lots of steps ​

### Alternative Approaches

- No permissions – some saw this as an opportunity to raise profiles and encourage collaboration, but others using the platform for sensitive content would be forced to move to another platform​
- ‘Subgroups’ and ‘roles’ – most felt this was a reasonable alternative to ‘Teams’ as it would allow them to assign ‘Subgroup managers’ and reduce the steps to add content for a specific group of people, therefore reducing their own admin​

## User Background

10 Users took part in the research. Out of the 10 users 9 were workspace managers.
