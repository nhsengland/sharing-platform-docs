# FutureNHS Permissions – 24th - 26th November 2021

## Permissions

- Use of workspace permissions​
- Use of teams and member permissions​
- Use of content permissions​

## Methodology

For this round of research we used a remote moderated one-to-one user research methodology. The sessions were conducted via video conference and screen sharing meeting on Teams, and participants joined from their desktop. The moderator and participant could see and hear each other in order to conduct the interview. Chat functionality allowed the moderator to provide instructions, and links to the wireframes. Participants accessed the platform & wireframes on their desktop and shared their screen. The moderator was able to see the participant’s screen and used concurrent think aloud (CTA) to understand their behaviour and asked interview questions.

## Summary

### Workspace Permissions

- Out of the 6 key account workspaces discussed, 2 were very large ‘Open’ workspaces designed to encourage collaboration, though still contained restricted folders or ‘subspaces’
- All other workspaces were set to ‘Private’ to control membership, though some questioned whether this was still necessary
- Registration to the platform itself was seen as a greater barrier to access than workspace permissions and many regularly had to support members with this process

### Members & Teams

- All 6 workspaces discussed in detail had setup teams to restrict content to a specific audience or region which were then assigned to a ‘subspace’ of content​
- Managers experienced difficulties setting and managing teams due to the lacking functionality and poor usability. For example, the inability to create ‘roles’, as well as difficulty navigating settings and assigning the correct individuals to the correct teams​

### Content Permissions

- Most used these to set content to ‘View’ only for members and then ‘Modify’ & ‘Create’ for managers and teams
- Although the options were considered appropriate the steps to set these were considered tedious. In particular, the way permissions are automatically assigned from a parent to a child, and how teams and content have to created separately and then applied to one another creating lots of steps ​

### Alternative Approaches

- No permissions – some saw this as an opportunity to raise profiles and encourage collaboration, but others using the platform for sensitive content would be forced to move to another platform​
- ‘Subgroups’ and ‘roles’ – most felt this was a reasonable alternative to ‘Teams’ as it would allow them to assign ‘Subgroup managers’ and reduce the steps to add content for a specific group of people, therefore reducing their own admin​

## User Background

10 Users took part in the research. Out of the 10 users 9 were workspace managers.

## Workspace Permissions

### Workspace Permissions Overview

- Out of 6 key account workspaces discussed in the session, 2 were ‘Open’ and the rest were ‘Private’

- The 2 open workspaces (‘Population Health Management Academy’ & ‘NHS Safeguarding Workspace’) are large workspaces that still had restricted folders or ‘subspaces’ within them. These restricted areas were used to create regional spaces or for particular sub-disciplines where content may be sensitive

- In both cases, managers saw the value in the main space remaining open for raising awareness and transparency. However, they felt being able to restrict certain content was useful as not everyone needs to see everything, and some content may be sensitive

The remaining workspaces were all ‘Private’. Managers were asked to explain why their workspace had been set this way:

- Modality – Managers acknowledged that a lot of the content is sensitive, so it needs to be kept private. This team are using the ‘Modality’ workspaces as a series of internal intranets for their regional teams, containing content that needs to be retained within divisions

- NHS Estates Team Collaboration Hub - This workspace has been Private since setup, managers have contemplated changing to ‘Restricted’ but management refuse, they want it  to be invite only and avoid any marketing companies seeing their space and asking to join. They also thought remaining private would reduce the admin of reviewing requests​

- National AHP Virtual Hub – Manager kept referring to the space being ‘open’ with restricted areas. They explained how mostly restricted areas hadn’t worked, more people engaged with open content and so the space was generally moving towards a more ‘open’ approach’ and as part of this they may review the ‘Private’ status and saw this as an opportunity to promote collaboration and reduce admin as well

- Estates hub – again, some confusion over whether this was private or not, saw the workspace in general as ‘open’ for transparency and discussion but then subgroups or folders containing restricted content as ‘restricted’ 

### Workspace Permissions - settings options

- One manager faced some confusion over the three options, particularly the ‘Open’ option. They explained that this wording was misleading given that the workspace is not truly open when you need to be a registered member of the platform to access it. 

- Registration to the platform is seen as more of a barrier to getting people invited and setup on a workspace. Workspace managers find themselves having to walk people through the registration process especially if users are non-NHS

- The manager of the Estates hub had even gone so far as creating a separate Teams site for non-NHS individuals to provide content without the hassle of signing up to the platform

### Workspace Permissions - If no longer available

- We asked managers with private workspaces what the impact would be if they could no longer restrict access and the default option was ‘Open’

- Out of the managers with private workspaces, some explained removing the option to restrict membership and force all workspaces to be ‘Open’ would force them to move certain content elsewhere, to another platform such as Sharepoint where they can restrict access

- However all were reluctant to do this as they saw FutureNHS as a really valuable tool that they had spent time setting up

- Others felt it would create a lot of admin to go through requests and assess whether individuals were suitable to accept, they did not have time for this task​

- The more senior manager of ‘National AHP virtual hub’ saw this as an opportunity to create an open and collaborative workspace, they felt most things could be shared openly on their workspace, though did acknowledge extra monitoring may have to be applied to forums

## Members & Teams

### Members & Teams – Reason for using teams

#### Managers had set up Teams on their workspaces to restrict content to a specific audience or region, these Teams were then usually assigned to a ‘Subspace’ on the workspace, where restricted content would be held

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/146407978-c46f5241-5242-4d43-bbb2-e01cc8b2e85d.png)

- Out of the 6 workspaces we discussed in greater detail, all had set up teams to restrict content in some capacity. Reasons for using teams were as follows:​

- Population Health Management Academy – ‘Teams’ used to assign people to regional subgroups​

- Modality – to control access to content that can't be shared between practices or divisions ​

- NHS Estates Team Collaboration Hub – one team used to create a restricted area for the internal team. This area is used as more of an intranet to share weekly updates, staff meetings etc.

- National AHP virtual hub – used to originally create restricted subspaces for different regions, however uptake was low, as most interacted using the open areas of the workspace instead – felt restrictions had actually limited collaboration. Now only really used for their ‘Chief AHP’ group who need a safe space to share content​

- Technical Standards and Guidance Programme hub – different ‘groups’ used for different sets of guidance. These are only relevant to certain teams and there may be instances where they don’t want individuals (such as contractors) to access

- Safeguarding – used to create subspaces for different regions or specialist teams (e.g. midwifes) and will also use to restrict areas in production before these are released to all members (preview)

### Members & Teams – Barriers & Pain Points

#### Managers experienced difficulties managing and setting up Teams due to limitations in functionality on Kahootz

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/146408360-a477c242-938f-4909-9f85-11295f912aa8.png)

- Some managers had difficulty using Teams or felt these could not currently be used to their full potential due to the way they must be setup and managed on Kahootz:​

- Roles – managers of modality found it a barrier that they can only have a single type of high-level manager for a workspace when they would like a level down, someone who can have admin rights but not necessarily see all content

- Roles – managers of Population Health Management Academy and Safeguarding had a desire to assign managers to separate Teams or subgroups without being managers of the entire workspace. They currently experienced difficulty understanding who notifications and private messages are applicable to, and have control over all teams when just need the ones they manage

- Team limit – larger workspaces have reached the 100 team limit and require more teams than this

### Members & Teams – Barriers & Pain Points

#### Managers experienced usability issues on the Kahootz platform when setting up and managing Teams

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/146408775-64d2a223-404d-4aeb-9423-45d77ccff4ba.png)

- When demonstrating their use of Teams, managers pointed out several usability issues that made managing teams difficult:

- Generally settings are difficult to navigate. There was confusion over which icon to use to get into settings, inconsistent navigation, similar options that are difficult to differentiate between, often multiple different routes to get to the same page

- Managers have to add people to a Team one at a time unless sending out invites. Invites are used as a workaround and even when editing Team permissions as it recognises they’re already registered and just changes their Team permissions instead

- When working with high number of teams, it’s difficult to find the correct team in the list as there is no logical order and no search. This also means in some cases duplicate Teams end up being created – managers suggested ordering them in alphabetical or most used

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/146408964-e2c5dfd5-c6ad-484c-b315-321f546adb3f.png)

- Usability issues continued:

- Difficulty using the table to manage members, only a small preview of the Team name is visible and if there are a high number of teams you have to scroll along, losing the members name and making it difficult to accurately select members. Managers suggested making the name column sticky and showing the full team title 

- Difficulty differentiating between individuals (especially if they have the same name). It would be useful to see job role as well

- 2 step process which could be more streamlined - once creating a Team, then have to connect the team to the content, however it would be easier to do this all in one place​

### Members & Teams – if no longer available

#### Most managers felt there would be some impact to the way they manage their workspace if Teams were no longer available. Many said they would be forced to move some content off the platform which would not be ideal

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/146409162-eeb1c003-b8e8-476e-94c9-ce5fe923d4eb.png)

- We asked managers what the impact would be on their workspace if the ‘Teams’ functionality was no longer available:​

- Population health management academy – not a massive difference would just have to be more careful what is being posted, and concern that some people would be put off posting if they knew it could be seen by anyone

- Modality – this would cause great challenges as they would be unable to ensure the right people are viewing content, they would be forced to use separate means to share sensitive content

- NHS Estates Team Collaboration Hub – they would not be able to host an internal team and content on the platform, and would be forced to do this elsewhere. Concerns because a lot of their team don’t use MS Teams and have members with lower digital skills who would have difficulty learning to use another new system

- Technical Standards and Guidance Programme hub – certain content would have to be removed from the platform and relocated elsewhere such as MS Teams

- Safeguarding – would have to be more careful what content was being shared and for more sensitive content, this may have to be shared over email instead which would not be ideal

## Content Permissions

### Content permissions – Use Cases

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/146409439-ae7ddb73-997d-4c02-a6c9-90b9ad54b952.png)

- When it came to setting permissions on particular pieces of content, most managers typically set these to ‘View’ only for members and then ‘Modify’ & ‘Create’ for managers and teams

- One manager who was in charge of content in a ‘subspace’ only explained they hadn’t given much thought to content specific permissions. They explained, as their subspace was restricted, they wanted it to be as open and flexible as possible for the people with access to encourage collaboration. On reflection they felt that content specific permissions could allow them to open up access to their ‘subspace’ and just restrict certain pieces of content if they are sensitive

### Content permissions – Barriers & Pain Points

#### Most felt the content permissions were appropriate, though some felt certain steps were tedious and could be improved

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/146409628-38f2aa8c-dbe5-41f3-a5ae-1d9f7a8c0b49.png)

- In terms of the options available, managers thought these were appropriate and felt there was little else required for restricting content

- However some explained assigning permissions could be tedious and time consuming, especially when adding content in bulk:

- One manager referred to how permissions are automatically copied from a parent to a child (folder to subfolder) and that this can be annoying and create lots of admin if they do not want the same content permissions to apply. They suggested adding a ‘would you like these permissions to be copied to all content within this folder?’ failsafe, or providing tick boxes to quickly apply or remove permissions

- Managers of the Safeguarding workspace explained their ‘regional managers’ have difficulty assigning teams to content. This is because they do not have full workspace manager status, so cannot see who is in a Team. They again suggested the ability to assign roles to be able to open up permissions to certain content or workspace settings without having full manager rights

- One manager explained how they found the 3 steps required to create a team, create content and then apply Team access to that piece of content, particularly tedious and explained they’d much rather manage all permissions in one place

## Kahootz Permissions - Overall

- Overall, despite some issues with usability and setup making permissions ‘clunky’, managers felt these were incredibly valuable to help them restrict access in their desired way. In some cases, permissions set Kahootz apart from other tools  

- When asked if there were any other tools or platforms they used where they had to manage permissions, some referred to Sharepoint but felt the it was overly complicated and not user friendly

## Response to Alternative Approaches

### Alternative Approaches - No Permissions

#### Whilst some felt the benefits of a completely open platform outweighed the risks, others felt this would force them to move to another tool

- We explained to managers that a goal of ours is to make the platform as open as possible to promote true collaboration across teams and workspaces. We asked them how it would impact their workspace if permissions were no longer available in the future. Responses were mixed:

- Some managers were open to the idea of making the platform as open as possible as they saw it as an opportunity to raise the profile of workspaces and encourage transparency in collaboration

- They acknowledged that some content would have to be removed from their workspace, but still felt the benefits outweighed this

- They also recognized this would remove a lot of the current barriers around registration, as well as their own admin in setting permissions

- For others, especially those using the platform to share sensitive data or as an internal intranet, this was a dealbreaker, and they explained they would be forced to use another tool or platform

- There was also some concern that members may be less likely to engage knowing that their comments etc are out in the open, some may only be comfortable sharing within smaller circles

### Alternative approaches – Subgroups or child groups with roles

#### Most responded well to this approach and saw real benefit in being able to create a content structure and assign roles

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/146410241-e6318ba5-a15e-4c64-86c7-5e69b9b9e432.png)

- We introduced managers to the concept of replacing teams with ‘Subgroups’ and then the ability to create ‘Roles’ for different permission levels.

- After getting their head around the concept, most managers felt this was a reasonable alternative as it allowed a similar structure to what they have currently, just replacing ‘Teams’ with ‘subgroups’

- Some saw real benefit in being able to create roles, particularly in being able to assign ‘Subgroup managers’ who have control of just the assigned subgroup, as this would reduce a lot of admin for those currently trying to manage multiple ‘Teams’

- Some mentioned the potential to create a ‘Content manager’ who has permission to create and modify content on the workspace or within a subgroup but without full manager permissions

- A real benefit was seen in the ‘site structure’ this would create, and admin steps reduced as a result. This approach would mean content is created within a subgroup and permissions would automatically be applied, rather then having to create a Team, then create content, then link the two together

#### Although there were few concerns raised around this approach, some wanted extra clarity on content permissions and migration

- Few risks or concerns were raised with this approach, though some did have questions or want extra clarity around the following:

- Some were unsure how this would affect content permissions. They questioned whether you would assign a role to individuals e.g. ‘view only’ or ‘view & modify’ or whether this would be set for individual pieces of content, similar to the current platform

- One user raised concerns over migration and questioned how they would get their current ‘subspaces’ and ‘Teams’ into this structure

### Other ideas / response to ‘Groups’

#### Most managers did not have any other ideas around how permissions could be managed, and the response to replacing ‘Workspaces’ with ‘Groups’ was mixed

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/146410682-187af5be-745f-4b3a-b5dc-f55e3325049c.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84839501/146410692-280a89d2-086b-41f2-939e-3c15ebde6d1e.png)

- When asked if they had any other ideas around how permissions could be managed, most struggled to think of anything beyond what had been discussed, but one user responded with:

- An opportunity to allow sign in as a guest before registering as a member. They see registration as a major barrier, so allowing users to see some content before going through sign up could entice them to join

- We asked users how they felt about the change in terminology from ‘Workspaces’ to ‘Groups’:

- Some felt this name was more suitable as it more accurately explains what it is for and is more ‘plain English’. ‘Workspace’ suggests you are an active working member of the space which for many isn’t the case, whereas ‘Group’ suggests more peer to peer networking

- Some felt it would be confusing to change the name when most have become familiar with the language ‘workspace’

- Particularly for workspaces who referred to themselves as a ‘Group’ e.g. ‘Modality Group’ they worried that this would create confusion

- Some also felt the word ‘group’ is too general and is used broadly across other workstreams and sharing platforms
