# Beta Usability - User testing June 2022 

## Introduction
Qualititative review and analysis of the beta platform service, consisting of usability research conducted with members of the beta community and a heuristic analysis conducted by the agency Simple Usability. 

This study was primarily conducted on desktop with one user accessing the service via mobile. The usability issues raised on mobile, highlighted a potential need for a stronger focus on mobile to ensure all user journeys are working, however this is only significant **IF** mobile access is considered a high enough priority. Note that overall, low user need has been evidenced for mobile access. 

This summary has focused on documenting the recommendations for improvement rather than things that tested well. 

### Method 
- 7 remote moderated user interviews with 6 workspace managers and 1 member
- Screen-shared walk through of typical user journeys of both members and managers – with a focus on talking to managers 
- Reviewed user journeys around using Groups, Forums, Files and Folders, Members, Search, Customer Support and Profiles
- Heuristic usability report compiled by agency Simple Usability 
- Findings of the two studies largely supported each other and were therefore generalised into a single report and a consolidated set of findings

### Research Goals
To evaluate the usability of the beta platform under development and identify issues that need to be addressed immediately as part of MVP and to identify longer term areas for improvement.  

These studies also helped us to:
- validate known user needs
- evaluate how well user needs are being met by the beta service
- assess the perceived importance of features for MVP  

# Summary of findings 

### Findings - by feature
Usability issues have been summarised according to the feature reviewed during each user journey. The majority of issues noted were apparent on desktop and worse on mobile. Any issues unique to mobile have been indicated. For the full set of findings and associated recommendations, contact details for the full report are provided below.

### Groups
My Groups area was understood as the most relevant starting point for user journeys, but it needs to be reviewed in terms of content and purpose, in order to develop the necessary level of relevance for both first time users and established users (who may have slightly differing needs.) Overall, meeting the need to be able to signpost members to specific content requires further design exploration, as does the journey to discovering new relevant content.

The Groups area in general surfaced several usability issues and recommendations:  
- Landing area lacked a focused starting point with regards to content and would benefit from more dynamism and relevance
- Navigation – key functional links are hidden within the dropdown  
- Fundamental design and navigation issues found with the menu on mobile 
- ‘Discover new groups’ was easy to find but could be more navigable to better support discovery - e.g. contextual keyword search, filter and sort may be useful
- ‘Join group’ action requires dynamic interaction and visual feedback to support user understanding
- The consequences of ‘Leave group’ as an action were unclear to users 
- Options around ‘Edit group’ were unclear


### Forums
When reading content, the forums area was largely understood and all the elements were considered useful. However some journeys could be supported better as some users found it difficult to follow threads of a discussion and to navigate meaningfully through the discussions.  The section would benefit from reviews of the: 
- overall layout to better highlight new and recent content - to indicate chronology 
- layout and hierarchy of the content and subsequent threads – to indicate related comments (and ‘show more replies.’)
- design of the original post to make it easier to find
- methods of presenting long lists of content – possibly with alternate types of navigation
- sort and/or search functions within forums 
- use of a timestamp
- terminology  – discussions vs forums

When adding comments or creating a discussion, the main issue was that the capabilities of the rich text editor were understood differently by different users and generated several usability issues. 
There was confusion around expectations for:
- embedding media
- adding attachments
- unfamiliar features 
- tables 


### Files and Folders
Users commented that Files and Folders resembled Sharepoint and were therefore somewhat familiar. The greatest concerns were over the loss of existing ‘pages’ as found and used on the Kahootz platform. User were worried the folder structure would need to be more carefully structured to signpost content as effectively as ‘pages.’ In addition, there were some navigation issues observed (particularly on mobile) and users relied on the breadcrumb.

Task specific usability issues included:
- lack of understanding around the purpose of the ‘Modified’ column  
- difficulties when looking for specific files - a search function was expected and within files, users expected to be able to refine and sort the list
- lack of tangible benefits with the ‘View details’ page

Creating a new folder was found to be straightforward, but there were usability issues associated with the:
- lack of permissions associated to editing a file
- long page titles, which may enable the creation of names that are overly long and difficult to scan - this additionally highlighted the importance of writing an effective description in conjunction with an appropriately clear name 
- lack of clarity around supported files for upload
- limited functionality around ‘Edit folder’ which didn’t follow established and familiar patterns on other platforms

### Members
- Users found members with ease, but expected a search, sort or refine function 
- Users expected more information related to the members, in reference to their use of the platform - particularly in regards to their status as member or admin of the group
- As a group manager, it was clear how to ‘Edit’, but there was uncertainty around different roles e.g. ‘Standard’ vs ‘Guest’

### My Profile
- Users found and edited the content without issues, but struggled to get back to their previous location – especially on mobile
- Users expected to be able to preview uploaded images
- Input field status as 'optional' and 'required' needs clarification

### Search
- On desktop users noticed the search bar and recognised it as site wide 
- Finding context specific results was problematic through various platform tasks – specific use cases need to be supported more effectively e.g. Find a group, find a person or find specific content
- Search results overall need to be improved to provide easier navigation, grouping, filtering and refinement  
- Analysis of searches to provide improved scenarios of ‘No results found’ would be useful e.g. ‘Did you mean’ or ‘Related results’

### Help and Support
- Users found and understood the link to the support site
- Some found the 'Contact us' link at the bottom of the page, but not all - users emphasised the importance of this function
- Several hoped to see a contact form to raise a specific ticket

## Migration - Issues with moving from Kahootz
Users struggled to see how their existing workspaces could be migrated to this new platform and requested additional functionality akin to what they have on Kahootz e.g. pages, subgroups, multiple forums, managers view, sorting and filtering, pinning. 
This emphasises the need to define a full roadmap of feature enhancements moving forward and to map user needs against MVP.
