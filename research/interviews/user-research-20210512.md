# FutureNHS User Research - 12 May 2021

## Objective
The focus of this user research was to gather perspectives from non-existing users and responses to wireframes from the UX design team. From a user background we wanted to learn their:
- Role in the NHS / related organisation
- Current awareness and understanding of the FutureNHS collaboration platform

The activities we asked them to perform on the wireframes were
- Platform registration
- Use of the user dashboard / 'homepage'
- Discoverability of new groups

## Methodology
For this round of research we used a remote moderated one-to-one user research methodology. The sessions were conducted via video conference and screen sharing meeting on Teams, and participants joined from their desktop. The moderator and participant could see and hear each other in order to conduct the interview
Chat functionality allowed the moderator to provide instructions, and links to the wireframes. Participants accessed the platform & wireframes on their desktop and shared their screen. The moderator was able to see the participant’s screen and used concurrent think aloud (CTA) to understand their behaviour and asked interview questions.

## User background
We interviewed 3 non-existing members of the platform, 1 dormant user and 1 new user. All were members of the NHS and had a good understanding of the platform.

Other tools and platforms used by the members were Teams, Sharepoint, Email, Zoom and Onedrive.

## Feedback on new protoypes

### Registration
#### Landing page

All users got started by hitting ‘Log In or Register’ without realising there was further content beneath the page fold.

All users got started by hitting the ‘Log In or Register’ call to action at the centre of the page or in the top navigation. 

No users realised there was content beneath the fold so did not naturally scroll to explore.

When asked users felt the information was useful, but they would be focused on getting started at this point as they would assume they would already have some understanding of the platform if registering.

Some suggested making this information available for later reference in case they require an introduction once signed up.

In general, users’ initial impressions were positive, they thought the site seemed, bright, friendly, and familiar due to the NHS colours and typeface.

Once user suggested making the imagery more diverse to reflect the complete workforce of the NHS.

#### Log In or register
Users were overwhelmed by the options, often initially drawn to the incorrect option or misinterpreting which they should choose to register.

All users were initially drawn to the fields to ‘Login with email and password’ to get started as they explained their natural response to seeing form fields is to fill them in

They explained they would have realised when trying to recall their password, or when an error message returned, that they were not yet registered.

Users explained they would then go to either the ‘Register’ options or ‘Log in via NHS’, though some suggested giving these equal weighting visually to make it clear these are the two ways to register – one for NHS and one for non-NHS workers, to ensure they choose the right one.

Some users felt the ‘Big Green button’ to register took prominence on the page, and should be put beneath the Log In options as this is something they will only use once.

#### Steps 1-3

Users understood the steps of registration, but had queries over entering Phone Numbers and Regions.

Users felt it was clear what the registrations steps would involve and how long it may take due to the progress indicator.

Two users noted they much prefer seeing a form separated across pages like this instead of on one long page.

Users thought the error message was clear, and understood this was because they’d used an invalid email domain.

Some users felt uneasy entering a Phone Number as they explained some staff do not have a work phone, so may have to enter their personal number here. They did not mention noticing whether this was a required field.

One user questioned the language ‘Company name’ as they considered the NHS to be ‘Organisations’ rather than companies.

One user was unsure whether their ‘Region’ should be the Region of their organisation or the Region they live in, and whether this would impact any targeted content they get on the platform.

#### Steps 4-6 – Learning, Expertise & Newsletter

Users liked being able to add areas of interest, but thought tags and input information could be improved.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9471595/118824736-fee3db80-b8b1-11eb-88d7-5fab185d2112.png)

Users were impressed by the concept of adding areas of interest and expertise, and expected content related to their interests to be surfaced or suggested as a result.

Most thought the tags provided a good range of areas, though one user suggested these did not include any sector specific areas such as ‘Cardiac care’ or ‘Mental Health’ which may be priority for clinical staff.

Users understood they should use the freetext box to add further tags but were unsure what format they needed to enter these in e.g. with hashtag, comma separated etc.

Some users liked being asked separately for their Learning then Expertise recognising these are different. Others worried that these would heavily overlap and surface the same content, therefore proving no requirement for both.

Users wanted some reassurance that they could adjust tags in future.

There was a mixed response to the newsletter question, though users seemed more likely to sign up knowing that they could unsubscribe at any time.

#### ‘Registration awaiting approval’
Users liked being able to add areas of interest, but thought tags and input information could be improved.

Most users were initially surprised when reaching this screen as they expected to sign straight into the platform and get started. 

On reflection most said it made sense to have to wait for approval, but some expected this to be almost instantaneous, and just involve an automated email requiring verification.

Users said they would leave the site at this point and wait for the approval email.

Users were not naturally drawn to the groups visible on the page. When asked they questioned the purpose of showing these if they had to wait for approval before being able to join.

If groups are to be shown here, one user suggested being able to click into them to see more detail instead of just ‘dangling the carrot’. 

*Note: Users faced confusion over the difference between joining the platform and joining a group, though this may be due to our wireframes not truly reflecting the sign-up process if pre-invited*

### User dashboard - 'Home'

#### Initial impressions and Getting started
Users understood where they had landed on the platform and likened the page to social media due to the prominence of feeds.

When arriving on the ‘Home’ page users recognised this was the central page of the platform or ‘dashboard’ where they would view updates and notifications, and navigate to other areas.

Users likened the page to a social media site or ‘Facebook’ due to the various feeds. They felt this was positive, as it made it feel ‘familiar’.

To get started most users said they would scroll the most recent updates or view notifications.

One user felt like there was too much going on, so struggled to pick out what was most relevant. They thought the page should just show updates, with the option to view notifications, favourites and groups from the left-hand navigation.

#### Updates panel
Although users understood this was a feed of updates, there was some uncertainty around where content was coming from.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9471595/118938446-91ce5580-b946-11eb-8e43-3026f5b6cd94.png)

Some users were initially unsure where updates were coming from – whether these were just from groups they were a member of or all groups.

Most users understood they were seeing updates from an amalgamation of sources, and that they could filter these by choosing just ‘Groups’ or ‘Forums’.

Seeing avatars and names for individuals led one user to believe that this was content coming from people they had ‘followed’ as opposed to groups or forums they were a member of.

Some users misinterpreted the ‘Groups’ and ‘Forums’ tabs within updates as navigational buttons, so tried to use these when navigating to Groups.

Most users understood the second group was one they were not yet a member of, they thought this was a useful way to surface recommended groups as they may not have time to explore groups themselves.

One user picked up on the fact that updates from favourited groups or forums had been flagged by a star icon. However they also thought it would be useful to save or flag individual updates or content to review later.

One user expected to be able to customise this page and control the content initially visible.

### Discovering Groups

#### Navigation
Most users got started discovering groups using the ‘Discover groups’ panel on the homepage.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9471595/118938682-d22dd380-b946-11eb-89ca-004eb57f1de9.png)

When asked to see if there was a way to find new groups 3 out of 5 users were drawn to the ‘Discover Groups’ panel on the ‘Home’ page and explained they had noticed this initially as a way to find new groups.

One user was drawn to the ‘Groups’ tab within updates expecting this would take them to all groups.

One user explained they would use the search bar, but explained they were unsure where this would search all platform content, or change dependent on the active page (e.g. within own groups, or a specific group / forum).

#### ‘Discover new groups’ page
Users understood they could get started by searching, choosing tags or reviewing the suggested groups.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9471595/118938825-f689b000-b946-11eb-8aad-c001a2c28e09.png)

When drawn to the search, some were unsure based on the title ‘Search for a group’ whether they could type in keywords or had to include a full group title.

Most users understood tags were a way to quickly filter down to trending topics and thought these would be useful.

However one user wanted to see their own tags appear here, not just trending.

One user was unsure how tags would work in conjunction with the search bar, whether these would apply to the search term entered or create an entirely new search based on the tag.

Some expected to see further filtering and sorting options to narrow down results.

Users felt the preview of group information was adequate, giving them a sufficient overview to make a decision about joining.

Some users felt the groups seemed limited to suggestions based on their interests or specific search terms. They wanted to be able to explore groups through a ‘Trending’ tab or ‘View all groups’.

#### General understanding of Groups
New users understood the concept of groups, but some explained the platform was different to what they expected.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9471595/118938947-16b96f00-b947-11eb-9106-abcd16c7572a.png)

Despite being new to the platform, users understood the concept of a group as a members area to discuss and share information about a specific topic. They thought this was clear based on the group and content previews they had seen.

Some users were disappointed to see just a list of groups under ‘Latest updated’. They wanted to see a preview or indication of the content that had been updated.

Although not naturally drawn to it in the session, most users understood the Group specific navigation was showing an index of their groups and thought these would be useful ‘Quick links’.

Although most responded positively to the ‘Groups’ section, finding it clear and easy to navigate. One user felt it was ‘clunky’ as the green banner took up too much space, and the tabs at the top of the page repeated sections in either the left-hand navigation or homepage.

Some users explained the platform was different to their expectations, feeling more like a social networking platform rather then somewhere to store and share files and documents.

### Navigation & Design

*Navigation*

All users naturally noticed the icons appearing in the left-hand navigation at some point in their journey and understood they could use these to jump between areas.

Most users had an accurate understanding of the icons, however two initially mistook Forums for ‘Chat’, and one user suggested having tooltips appear to explain on hover over.

Once within groups, users who were asked did not understand the collapse icon. Some thought this may be ‘log out’. They suggested keeping it in-line with the relevant panel, and using an chevron as this is what they are used to seeing on other applications.

*Design*

Overall, most users felt the platform seemed easy to use, self-explanatory, and visually pleasing.

They thought it felt professional and like it belonged to the NHS without feeling ‘too clinical’.
