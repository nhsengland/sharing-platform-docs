# Notifications - 11th & 14th February 2022

## User Research Overview

### Migration Research Aim
- To understand how managers and members want to keep up to date with any changes or activity on the platform and to review early designs and concepts for notifications on FNHS 2.0

### Persona validation & User / workspace background 
- Role in the NHS / related organisation & how they collaborate as part of their role to identify persona group
- Current use of the FutureNHS platform

### Notifications
- Needs around receiving updates on activity or changes on the platform
- Thoughts on existing notifications on Kahootz

### Reviewing notification designs
- Series of designs were shared to reflect a core notifications journey as well as alternative locations and appearances. These can all be found in the appendix

### Methodology
- For this round of research we used a remote moderated one-to-one user research methodology.
- The sessions were conducted via video conference and screen sharing on Teams, and participants joined from their desktop.
- The moderator and participant could see and hear each other in order to conduct the interview.
- The moderator shared their screen to demonstrate the experience map on miro, as well as the 2.0 version of the participants’ workspace. Interview questions were asked throughout to understand natural responses, concerns and opportunities.

### Who took part?
- 2 x members
- 8 x managers 
- Including 1 x mobility impaired user using Dragon software and 2 x dyslexic users
-

### Summary Findings

#### Notifications were considered essential, and the new designs were seen as an improvement 
- For both managers and members, receiving key updates on changes or activityon the platform was considered essential
- Most felt email was the best way to be initially  alerted of changes but felt it was not necessary to receive individual emails for every update. Most criticised Kahootzfor the volume and vagueness of emails they received
- Most were unaware in-platform notifications existed on the Kahootz platform, and those who were felt they were too generic
- Overall users responded positively to new designs for notifications, commenting that the look and feel was a big improvement on the new platform and made it more user friendly
- They particularly liked the idea of having a single page where they could view all notifications as a manager and member and some explained they may be less dependent on email if this was available

## Notifications Needs and Expectations

### Members Needs

### Question: Do you need to keep up to date with changes, activity and actions on the platform and if so, how?

### Updates Required
- Members wanted to be updated about key changes relevant to them
- New questions in their workspace
- Someone has replied to their question
- A new document or content has been shared of high importance

### Methods of Receiving 

- Both members hoped to see these  updates in-platform, one mentioned these being under a ‘bell icon’
- One mentioned exploring the notifications area in Kahootzbut explained they felt the updates were irrelevant
- Both found current email notifications from the Kahootzplatform intrusive and disengaging so in some cases had deactivated these. They felt aconcise summary via email once or twice a week may be useful but nothing more

### Managers Needs

### Question: Do you need to keep up to date with changes, activity and actions on the platform and if so, how? 

### Updates Required
- Managers felt it’s essential they receive updates, particularly for
- New members requesting to join / accepting invitations
- New documents added 
- Forum posts or responses
- Meetings and events 
- Activity reports (workspace usage)
- One wanted to know about changes to documents (versions) but others felt this could get overwhelming
- Managers noted that there was a fine balance to strike, providing them with key updates or changes but with no need to be updated about every bit of activity

### Methods of receiving
- When asked how they would like to receive updates, most felt emails were the best way to be initially notified to prompt them to access the platform. They explained they have their emails open all day anyway 
- However one manager felt these could be contained within the site as they disliked emails currently, and was concerned about the quantity they would receive
- One user felt it would be best to give managers the choice as to the updates they would like to receive and how they would like to receive these
- No managers naturally mentioned any alternative methods of notifications at this point

## Kahootz Feedback

### Existing notifications were considered important but insufficient

#### Emails
- Essential at the moment as these are the driver to interact with the platform but receive far too many
- Most managers recalled difficulty differentiating between notifications from workspaces they are a member of vs a manager of, explaining they sometimes have to scroll all the way to the bottom of an email to see this
- Subjects on emails are the same, meaning users have to go into each one to check workspace and topic
- For some, emails go to junk by default, so some recalled having to proactively check
- Some reported not getting emails from priority workspaces or getting them from workspaces they did not need notifications for, suggesting they were unaware they could manage notifications

#### In-Platform
- Many were completely unaware these exist, and those who were aware felt they are too generic, and it’s not obvious when a new one is added

## No Notifications
#### Updates or prompts from the platform were considered an important way to be alerted of activity or actions

- Managers especially felt it would be problematic to not receive any updates from the platform. In particular, email was considered an important prompt to alert them of activity and login to respond if necessary. Without this, they felt it would be too time consuming to have to routinely check the platform along with other channels
- Members were less precious about notifications but still felt it would be useful to have these otherwise they would have to proactively check workspaces or forums for updates or to track activity, which they may forget to do

## Notifications Design Feedback

### First steps
#### We asked users to demonstrate their first steps if arriving on the platform to check for changes or updates 
- 4 users got started by clicking the notifications  icon, explaining that this icon aligned with their mental model of a way to be alerted of updates or changes
- 2 users got started by looking for updates in-situ. They clicked on one of the groups visible, explaining they would hope to find any new content or anything needing their attention within these
- 4 users were unsure  how to get started, they explained they would expect to be directed to the relevant area of the platform from the link in their email.
- When prompted to see if there was anything on the page that may help them find these updates, 2 were quickly drawn to the notifications icon
- However, 2 were not drawn to the icon, and remained confused with where to go. These managers had difficulty adjusting to the new designs in general as these felt very unfamiliar to them. They were both slightly less tech savvy

### Notifications, Location and Icon

#### Users felt the notification icon was appropriate, but some challenged its location
- Users felt the icon was appropriate for notifications as this was considered a universal icon across websites and apps
- Users felt seeing the number of outstanding notifications in red was also an effective way to draw their attention to the icon and inline with their expectations
- Some felt the location of the icon down the left hand side was appropriate as it sat with other key navigational icons and reflected other apps like Teams
- Two users felt it would be useful if this left hand navigation bar was sticky, so followed them as they scrolled the page
- One user questioned how this would appear on mobile, and suggested it be made into a menu they could click to open (similar to hamburger)
- Others felt the top navigation bar would be more appropriate as this was where they were used to seeing notifications alongside account options
- The accessibility  user dependent on dragon software explained the menu icons down the left hand side were especially small and if not hyperlinked they would have to use MouseGridto select the notifications icon

### Notifications Expections

#### The notifications page was in-line with user expectations
- Before clicking on the icon, we asked users what they expected from the notifications section
- Most users explained they expected to be taken to a separate page where they would see six new notifications clearly defined with the option to click on these to view
- Some explained they expect anything in this section to be specific to them and not generic to an entire group
- Users expected this page to contain multiple types of notifications such as comments on discussion forums as well as requests to access their workspace. They mentioned having to check separate places for these on the current platform, so said having them all in one place would be useful
- One user suggested it may be useful to see a nested list of notifications separated by group
- When arriving on the notifications page, most users were impressed, explaining it was in-line with what they expected and an improvement on the current platform

#### Notifications Page

#### Visual indicators and tags were useful but could be more prominent

- Majority of users felt it was clear to understand read vs unread notifications using a combination of the darker colourand ‘unread’ tags
- One dyslexic user explained it was especially useful to have two visual prompts to indicate unread notifications
- However some users felt the contrast of the unread notifications did not stand out enough, especially for users with visual impairments
- Some users also initially missed the ‘unread’ tags, explaining these were not obvious enough in colouror size
- Most managers who noticed the ‘Manager’ tags, understood that these indicated the notifications relevant to them as a manager rather than a member, and felt these were a useful addition
- However some were initially unsure what this tag related to and needed an explanation from the moderator

#### Urgent tags were considered useful but there was uncertainty around how these would be assigned

- Those who noticed the ‘urgent’ tags also felt these were a useful addition, explaining they would expect these to be used for anything needing immediate action or for national updates
- When asked how they would expect urgent items to be flagged, they expected this to be applied by the individual who made the post or comment or for system alerts
- However some users felt that what is urgent to one person may not be for everyone, so the option to flag your own notifications as ‘urgent’ would be useful

#### Most understood what notifications were about, where they had come from, and where the links would take them

- Most users felt the notifications were displayed well and it was clear what the notification was about (comment, invitation etc.) who it had come from, and the group it was associated with
- Some felt it was useful to see the preview of content as this helped to provide context before actioning
- However some felt the page appeared too crowded, so suggested removing preview text as this took up unnecessary space when they would have to click on the notification to do anything with it anyway
- One user suggested introducing icons similar to other platforms to help differentiate types of notifications, such as an ‘@’ sign for mentions
- Users recognisedthere were different hyperlinks on the notifications, generally they expected
- Clicking name of an individual to take them to the member’s profile
- Clicking the name of the group to take them to the group homepage
- Clicking anywhere else on the notification to take them directly to the discussion post or content being flagged

#### Users liked the option to action notifications directly on the page

- Users were impressed by the option to action notifications directly from this page using the calls to action. They felt it was clear how they could interact with these, and that this would speed up their process
- If they wanted more information, they expected to be able click anywhere else on the notification to be taken to the content or member profile. They were pleased when this was the case, and the option to action was still clearly visible
- Some managers expected more information on the member profile page, including organisation, job role and reason for wanting to join
- The accessibility  user dependent on Dragon voice activated software explained it would be difficult to command selection of the correct ‘Accept’ button, so suggested these be labelled ‘Accept 1’, ‘Accept 2’ etc. to help differentiate
- One user felt the calls to action took up too much space on the notifications and drew attention away from the tags and other key information

#### Most were pleased with the feedback  they received once actioning a notification 

- Once actioning the notification, most were pleased with the feedback given acknowledging that the notification had been actioned 
- However some users felt they did not need to know this immediately after clicking ‘Accept’ and felt it took up unnecessary space on the page. One suggested a toast notification, just to acknowledge  their action, would be more useful

### Viewing Notifications

#### Users were pleased to see the unread forum comment highlighted but some questioned the order of comments

- When clicking a notification, in particular the ‘Penny Flarkecommented on your post...’ users expected this to take them directly to the comment in subject rather than just the top of the discussion forum
- When arriving on the page, users were therefore pleased to see that the latest comment appeared at the top of the page and in a darker colourto make it clear it was ‘unread’
- However one user questioned what would happen if they had been away from the platform for some time, would all unread comments still display in blue or only the one they had just clicked on
- Some felt it was strange to see comments in reverse chronological order, and said instead, they would expect to see comments in chronological order but to be jumped directly to the comment from the notification

### Managing Notifications

#### Users had different expectations  around where they would manage notifications

- When asked where they expected to be able to manage notifications
- Some users expected this to be in a generic ‘settings’ area under their account
- Two users suggested having this available within notifications, perhaps in the space at the top right of the page
- One user was unsure, they thought this may be within groups, where within settings for each they would be able to manage group-related notifications
- One user hovered over the new ‘managers dashboard’ icon and explained this looked like a settings area where they may be able to make such preferences

### Notifications Page

#### Users expressed areas they thought could be improved or features that were missing

- When asked if there was anything that was missing or could be improved, users mentioned
- (4 users) The option to mark as read or unread as a way of managing notifications that they don’t need to review, or would like to come back to later
- (3 users) Filtering options allowing user to filter by read / unread, manager vs members and urgent notifications
- (2 users) The option to delete notifications they had actioned or considered irrelevant
- (2 user) the exact date and time stamp for each notification rather than just the number of hours ago, otherwise they have to do the maths
- (1 user) Ensuring they can scroll the list infinitely rather than separating notifications onto paginated pages to reduce the number of clicks
- (1 user) show notifications in nested lists according to whether they are manager or member notifications (instead of tags)
- (1 user) an ‘accept all’ button for group access requests

## Alternative Notifications Designs

### Alternative Locations

#### Users who naturally mentioned seeing new activity in-situ or via the top-nav were shown these designs

- Out of the two users who explored the in-situ designs
- One user felt it was useful to have any new content flagged within the relevant section such as Forums in case they had not come from the notifications section. They suggested making both available for different mental models
- Another felt the visual appearance was too busy. They suggested retaining the number of outstanding notifications on the ‘Forums’ and ‘Files’ tabs may be useful but showing them against each discussion made the page appear cluttered
- One user was shown the alternative location for notifications in the top-navigation bar after expressing a dislike for the left-hand navigation bar as this did not align with their expectations. However when shown the alternative location, they said having navigational options across two places felt disjointed, so they preferred seeing the section in the left-hand nav bar after all

### Managers Dashboard

##### Managers were impressed by the dashboard but felt it was not necessary to have notifications here too

- Out of the three users who explored the manager dashboard, one thought it was clear this would be a ‘dashboard’ but unsure what for, whilst the others felt the icon was unclear
- Once arriving on the page, most understood this was an area specific to them where they could see settings, permissions and updates relating to managing their workspaces
- Managers responded particularly well to having analytics and reporting available on this page as these were difficult to access on the existing Kahootzplatform
- Two of the three users felt it was unnecessary to see notifications here as well, and instead felt these should be grouped together in a single location –the notifications page
- The other manager felt having them in both places was a useful additional prompt
- If managing multiple workspaces,  managers expected to see these in a nested list down the left-hand side of the page, allowing them to quickly jump between settings and options for each

### Notifications Page – Filtering

#### Users responded positively to filters but suggested these took up too much space and options needed extra clarity

- A number of users naturally mentioned expecting to see filters on the notifications page, so were pleased to see a design containing these
- Some managers explained it would be useful to see filters for individual workspaces under ‘Manager’ and ‘Member’. Users were therefore pleased to see group filters in the second design example but wanted to see these as well as filtering by content type (group, forum etc.)
- Some users felt filters took up too much screen space, so  suggesting reducing the size of these, or having them under accordians, allowing them to open or close them instead of being open by default
- The accessibility  user dependent on Dragon voice command software had concerns around the positioning of filters and wondered whether when they tried to ‘tab’ between filter options, the navigational icons may be picked up instead if not setup correctly
- One user was unsure what the difference was between a ‘Forum’ notification and a ‘Comment’ notification, and a ‘File’ and ‘Folder’, so would need extra clarity here
- One user felt seeing the icons against groups was too busy, so tick boxes, similar to the filter design, would be more appropriate

### Notifications Page - Icons

#### User felt icons were a useful addition and understood the content type these related to

- All users who were shown the designs containing icons felt these were a useful addition to help them differentiate between notification type
- Users understood the different icons and the content type these related to (e.g. groups, forums etc.)
