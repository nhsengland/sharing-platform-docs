# Notifications - 11th & 14th February 2022

## User Research Overview

### Migration Research Aim
- To understand how managers and members want to keep up to date with any changes or activity on the platform and to review early designs and concepts for notifications on FNHS 2.0

### Persona validation & User / workspace background 
- Role in the NHS / related organisation & how they collaborate as part of their role to identify persona group
- Current use of the FutureNHS platform

### Notifications
- Needs around receiving updates on activity or changes on the platform
- Thoughts on existing notifications on Kahootz

### Reviewing notification designs
- Series of designs were shared to reflect a core notifications journey as well as alternative locations and appearances. These can all be found in the appendix

### Methodology
- For this round of research we used a remote moderated one-to-one user research methodology.
- The sessions were conducted via video conference and screen sharing on Teams, and participants joined from their desktop.
- The moderator and participant could see and hear each other in order to conduct the interview.
- The moderator shared their screen to demonstrate the experience map on miro, as well as the 2.0 version of the participants’ workspace. Interview questions were asked throughout to understand natural responses, concerns and opportunities.

### Who took part?
- 2 x members
- 8 x managers 
- Including 1 x mobility impaired user using Dragon software and 2 x dyslexic users

### Summary Findings

#### Notifications were considered essential, and the new designs were seen as an improvement 
- For both managers and members, receiving key updates on changes or activityon the platform was considered essential
- Most felt email was the best way to be initially  alerted of changes but felt it was not necessary to receive individual emails for every update. Most criticised Kahootzfor the volume and vagueness of emails they received
- Most were unaware in-platform notifications existed on the Kahootz platform, and those who were felt they were too generic
- Overall users responded positively to new designs for notifications, commenting that the look and feel was a big improvement on the new platform and made it more user friendly
- They particularly liked the idea of having a single page where they could view all notifications as a manager and member and some explained they may be less dependent on email if this was available

## Notifications Needs and Expectations

### Members Needs

### Question: Do you need to keep up to date with changes, activity and actions on the platform and if so, how?

### Updates Required
- Members wanted to be updated about key changes relevant to them
- New questions in their workspace
- Someone has replied to their question
- A new document or content has been shared of high importance

### Methods of Receiving 

- Both members hoped to see these  updates in-platform, one mentioned these being under a ‘bell icon’
- One mentioned exploring the notifications area in Kahootzbut explained they felt the updates were irrelevant
- Both found current email notifications from the Kahootzplatform intrusive and disengaging so in some cases had deactivated these. They felt aconcise summary via email once or twice a week may be useful but nothing more

### Managers Needs

### Question: Do you need to keep up to date with changes, activity and actions on the platform and if so, how? 

### Updates Required
- Managers felt it’s essential they receive updates, particularly for
- New members requesting to join / accepting invitations
- New documents added 
- Forum posts or responses
- Meetings and events 
- Activity reports (workspace usage)
- One wanted to know about changes to documents (versions) but others felt this could get overwhelming
- Managers noted that there was a fine balance to strike, providing them with key updates or changes but with no need to be updated about every bit of activity

### Methods of receiving
- When asked how they would like to receive updates, most felt emails were the best way to be initially notified to prompt them to access the platform. They explained they have their emails open all day anyway 
- However one manager felt these could be contained within the site as they disliked emails currently, and was concerned about the quantity they would receive
- One user felt it would be best to give managers the choice as to the updates they would like to receive and how they would like to receive these
- No managers naturally mentioned any alternative methods of notifications at this point

## Kahootz Feedback

### Existing notifications were considered important but insufficient

#### Emails
- Essential at the moment as these are the driver to interact with the platform but receive far too many
- Most managers recalled difficulty differentiating between notifications from workspaces they are a member of vs a manager of, explaining they sometimes have to scroll all the way to the bottom of an email to see this
- Subjects on emails are the same, meaning users have to go into each one to check workspace and topic
- For some, emails go to junk by default, so some recalled having to proactively check
- Some reported not getting emails from priority workspaces or getting them from workspaces they did not need notifications for, suggesting they were unaware they could manage notifications

#### In-Platform
- Many were completely unaware these exist, and those who were aware felt they are too generic, and it’s not obvious when a new one is added

## No Notifications
#### Updates or prompts from the platform were considered an important way to be alerted of activity or actions

- Managers especially felt it would be problematic to not receive any updates from the platform. In particular, email was considered an important prompt to alert them of activity and login to respond if necessary. Without this, they felt it would be too time consuming to have to routinely check the platform along with other channels
- Members were less precious about notifications but still felt it would be useful to have these otherwise they would have to proactively check workspaces or forums for updates or to track activity, which they may forget to do

## Notifications Design Feedback

### First steps
#### We asked users to demonstrate their first steps if arriving on the platform to check for changes or updates 
- 4 users got started by clicking the notifications  icon, explaining that this icon aligned with their mental model of a way to be alerted of updates or changes
- 2 users got started by looking for updates in-situ. They clicked on one of the groups visible, explaining they would hope to find any new content or anything needing their attention within these
- 4 users were unsure  how to get started, they explained they would expect to be directed to the relevant area of the platform from the link in their email.
- When prompted to see if there was anything on the page that may help them find these updates, 2 were quickly drawn to the notifications icon
- However, 2 were not drawn to the icon, and remained confused with where to go. These managers had difficulty adjusting to the new designs in general as these felt very unfamiliar to them. They were both slightly less tech savvy

### Notifications, Location and Icon

#### Users felt the notification icon was appropriate, but some challenged its location
- Users felt the icon was appropriate for notifications as this was considered a universal icon across websites and apps
- Users felt seeing the number of outstanding notifications in red was also an effective way to draw their attention to the icon and inline with their expectations
- Some felt the location of the icon down the left hand side was appropriate as it sat with other key navigational icons and reflected other apps like Teams
- Two users felt it would be useful if this left hand navigation bar was sticky, so followed them as they scrolled the page
- One user questioned how this would appear on mobile, and suggested it be made into a menu they could click to open (similar to hamburger)
- Others felt the top navigation bar would be more appropriate as this was where they were used to seeing notifications alongside account options
- The accessibility  user dependent on dragon software explained the menu icons down the left hand side were especially small and if not hyperlinked they would have to use MouseGridto select the notifications icon

### Notifications Expections

#### The notifications page was in-line with user expectations
- Before clicking on the icon, we asked users what they expected from the notifications section
- Most users explained they expected to be taken to a separate page where they would see six new notifications clearly defined with the option to click on these to view
- Some explained they expect anything in this section to be specific to them and not generic to an entire group
- Users expected this page to contain multiple types of notifications such as comments on discussion forums as well as requests to access their workspace. They mentioned having to check separate places for these on the current platform, so said having them all in one place would be useful
- One user suggested it may be useful to see a nested list of notifications separated by group
- When arriving on the notifications page, most users were impressed, explaining it was in-line with what they expected and an improvement on the current platform
