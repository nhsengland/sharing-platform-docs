# FutureNHS User Research - 9th June 2021
## Objective
The focus of this research was to build an understanding of current usage of Permissions and Notifications by Members and Workspace managers. On the current Kahootz platform, we were interested  in:
* Managing permissions (workspace managers)
* Managing notifications (workspace managers & members)
* Using notifications (members & time allowing for managers)
The activities we asked users to perform on early wireframes were:
* Using in-platform notifications
## Methodology
For this round of research we used a remote moderated one-to-one user research methodology. The sessions were conducted via video conference and screen sharing meeting on Teams, and participants joined from their desktop. The moderator and participant could see and hear each other in order to conduct the interview. Chat functionality allowed the moderator to provide instructions, and links to the wireframes. Participants accessed the platform & wireframes on their desktop and shared their screen. The moderator was able to see the participant’s screen and used concurrent think aloud (CTA) to understand their behaviour and asked interview questions.
## User background
We interviewed 2 members who used the platfrom to keep up to date and share information across organisations.
We interviewed 4 workspace managers with varying levels of experience, who use the platform to enable sharing and manage and edit content.
## Summary
### Permissions
* Managers felt permissions on the platform worked well, allowing them to restrict and grant access in a way that was more straightforward compared to other platforms.
* Some had difficulty navigating to and around permissions due to the duplication of and confusion between options.
* Managers are using teams as a way to restrict areas to certain members but also to setup and view ‘test’ areas of their site in the absence of ‘preview’ functionality.
### Manager notifications
* Few managers had set notifications for their workspace.
* Managers were unaware or felt uncomfortable with the fact that notification settings they enforce will override those chose by the user.
* Due to a combination of this discomfort and also a lack of understanding of the notification options available, most managers had created their own means to provide key updates to members.
### Receiving notifications
* Members relied heavily on email notifications as a way to keep up to date with their workspaces, and when asked explained they had not noticed the option to review notifications in-platform.
* Managers also relied heavily on emails as an initial prompt to access the platform, but would then use in-platform notifications to check new and outstanding updates.
* Users felt more could be done in emails and in-platform to help differentiate between notifications  from different workspaces and content type.
### Wireframes
* All preferred the new designs for notifications, as options were more visible and easier to navigate.
* They likened the designs to Social Media explaining the familiarity made them straightforward to use.
## Permissions (managers only)
### Workspace permissions
**Managers had a good understanding of the workspace permissions available but some felt additional options would be useful**

When asked to show us how they would change workspace permissions, managers navigated to these under ‘Workspace settings’ with ease and had a good understanding of the options available.

Managers were aware of the high-level permission currently set on their workspace and the rationale for setting it this way.

Some recounted instances of changing their workspace permissions, for example from Restricted to Public in line with the use of their workspaces.

One user wanted to be able to create a public landing page for their workspace, explaining that having their workspace sit behind FutureNHS makes it difficult to find and access, particularly for those outside of the NHS.

Some managers explained they did not see the purpose of a ‘Private’ workspace, as this does not support the ‘collaborative’ intention of the platform and could lead to duplication of workspaces.

One user explained the option to allow Members to invite people to the workspace had been especially valuable in the growth of their workspace.

One manager felt it would be useful to open up access according to whether individuals are applying with a nhs.net email address to cut down on manual management.

### Member permissions

**Despite some difficulty navigating, managers use the ‘Manage Member’ area to review, edit and delete members and create teams**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84128097/123646467-25852280-d81f-11eb-9d76-d5b1f191c54b.png)

When navigating to member permissions, some users hesitated on how to access this, hovering between the Hamburger and Cog icon. Users managed to access permissions in both of these ways but explained it can be confusing navigating workspace permissions.

Users used the ‘Manage members’ area to review members, make individuals a manager or remove dormant users.

Three managers had utilised the ‘Teams’ function on their workspace and explained they used these to create restricted subsites on their workspace that contained content they only wanted certain users of their worksapce to have access to. Although the other two users had not needed to use this function, they acknowledged it was a useful feature.

Three managers used permissions and Teams as a way to preview content as a member before implementation. They had created a test area where they’d restricted access to certain members allowing them to make changes and preview how things might look with dummy accounts before implementing in public areas. They suggested allowing managers to preview content in a member’s view would save them having to do this.

When trying to find a way to add members to teams or as managers, one user struggled to find the drop-down which allowed them to switch to the correct view under ‘Permissions’. They explained that they often struggle to navigate their way around the member permissions area.

One manager explained it would be useful to see Organisation in the member summary table, especially when using this to select team members as for them they are likely to want to align teams with organisations or trusts.

One manager wanted to be able to set additional levels of permissions. They ran a workspace made up of a several regions and explained they wanted to be able to assign a member in each region to managerial responsibilities such as accepting invites to ease their workload. However they could not find a way to do this without making them workspace managers which wouldn’t be suitable across regions. They explained they thought the only way around this was to break their workspace down into several new ones.

### Content permissions

**Though there was some confusion on how to access content permissions, managers found the options available useful.**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84128097/123646866-83196f00-d81f-11eb-81e9-bc50aa4ce9f6.png)

When showing us how they check and edit permissions on content there was some confusion around how to access these settings. This was due to mix up between the options to ‘Modify’ or ‘View’ permissions, and the duplication of these in both the menu at the top of the page and actions options at the bottom.

When uploading content, managers explained they would use the ‘Permissions’ section to set who could view and modify the content as well as what could be added within this.

They explained they were able to do this with ease and particularly liked the feature to ‘Copy Permissions’ as they would often want to apply settings to everything within an area.

### Permissions Overall

**Overall, managers felt permissions on FutureNHS worked well when compared to other collaboration tools**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84128097/123647301-e1dee880-d81f-11eb-9d51-f773954acf98.png)

Overall managers felt despite the issues raised, Permissions on FutureNHS worked well.

They felt they were generally easier than Sharepoint and Teams, as although options available for content and users are similar, they feel they don’t get issues with these conflicting in the same way they’ve experienced elsewhere.

## Manager notifications

**Few managers had set notifications for their workspace as they either did not fully understand the settings or were unaware of them**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84128097/123647500-08048880-d820-11eb-9767-2314634cae5f.png)

Few managers had set specific notifications on their workspace.

They had noticed the options to do this for particular pieces of content, but felt the options were confusing. They were unsure what ‘additional members’ referred to and were happy for any notifications on content to be based on members’ own subscriptions rather than overriding these.

Managers were unaware they could edit members’ notification settings in the member area of their workspace. They felt unconformable being able to have this control and explained they would be unlikely to use it unless requested by the user, as they wanted to respect members’ preferences.

**Managers had often found alternative ways to notify users of key updates**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84128097/123650115-31beaf00-d822-11eb-8065-205e2eac6a5f.png)

One manager did actively override member’s notification settings by sending out a weekly roundup email to communicate updates. Although acknowledging this was not an ideal way to do it, they felt it was important members received these updates.

One manager explained they preferred to send their own emails to existing members as this way they could tailor the content to avoid it seeming generic, and they did not like the formatting of automated emails from Kahootz.

Two managers mentioned using the discussion forums as a way to push updates, as the ability to Tag people and ‘Broadcast’ enabled them to ensure updates are seen.

One manager wanted the ability to be able to force reminders for calendar invites sent through the platform. This would save them time as they were currently having to do this manually.

One manager wanted to be able to set notifications for content on the workspace homepage which us not currently available.

## Notifications (members & time allowing for managers)

### Email notifications

**Members would scan their email notifications and use these as a prompt to access the platform if relevant**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84128097/123647849-5ade4000-d820-11eb-89ed-45739f7caa02.png)

Members explained they were usually prompted to access the platform by email notifications, they are unlikely to sign in to the platform without this prompt.

They received both a weekly summary email and then more regular emails from specific workspaces. They understood they set notification preferences when joining a workspace and were able to change these within their settings if needed.

Members would have a quick scan of their notifications once seeing it in their inbox and either delete it if it’s not relevant, or click a link / flag for later if interested.

Engagement was higher with workspace specific emails around content or discussion posts as these were deemed more relevant than a generic summary detailing documents had been added.

One user did not realise the weekly summary email provided a summary for multiple workspaces as they had never scrolled the full email. They assumed it was all about the workspace appearing at the top, which was not so relevant to them so would delete this. They suggested making it clearer this was a summary for multiple workspaces, and ordering according to most used workspaces or favourites.

**Although users felt emails were an effective way to communicate updates, but suggested visual improvements**

Most users felt the email notifications worked well as a way to flag updates and prompt them to access the platform. They explained the process of accessing the relevant area of the platform using links in the email was straightforward.

However both members and managers felt more could be done to differentiate between different workspaces and content by adding distinct logos and colours for each workspace, and then icons to reflect types of content such as ‘documents’ ‘folder’ ‘discussion’ etc. They explained this would help them decipher relevant updates without having to read in detail.

### In-platform notifications

**Members had not previously noticed the in-platform notifications and felt their were unlikely to use these**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9471595/123765835-04274380-d8be-11eb-8d9a-9df7ccd63e63.png)

Both members had not previously noticed or used the in-platform notifications. They suggested this was perhaps due to the subtlety of the pending notification icon in the top navigation.

They felt they were unlikely to use this feature as it would involve them actively coming to the platform to check if they have notifications, whereas they prefer scanning and filtering notifications in emails first.

When reviewing these notifications one user felt there were more notifications here than what they receive over email and was unsure why the two were not the same.

On the notifications page, one user commented that it wasn’t clear which workspaces notifications had come from and felt this should be more obvious.

Similar to the email, it was suggested icons are added to notifications to help decipher the type of content.

Users did not naturally engage with the option to sort notifications. When prompted one user felt these were limited as they were only helpful if you had a combination of read and unread.

### Managing notifications (Email preferences)

**Members had not previously managed their Email Preferences but were able to find this with ease**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84128097/123648333-c45e4e80-d820-11eb-8b11-3d4cc76c8ab5.png)

Although aware they could change their notification settings, this is not something users had done before.

When prompted to find a way to edit their notification settings, they found this in their account settings with ease.

Users understood the ‘Email preferences’ options, and felt it was clear how they would edit their general settings as well as any workspace specific settings. They particularly liked the option to change the frequency of summary emails for each workspace.

One user experienced conflicting notifications that they struggled to solve. They were receiving daily email notifications from one of their workspaces despite their settings being set to receive ‘weekly’ updates. They figured this may be because they had subscribed to specific content on the workspace, but upon checking ‘Subscriptions’ there was nothing present for this workspace. (This may have been due to the fact that workspace managers can override personal settings).

### Managing notifications (Subscriptions)

**Users could not remember setting subscriptions and were unsure how to remove these, or how they affected email notifications**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84128097/123648476-e1931d00-d820-11eb-91d0-3d22d460de28.png)

When reviewing their ‘subscriptions’ users often did not remember setting these. When looking for a way to manage, they were unsure how to manage these without unsubscribing from the entire workspace due to the call to action visible.

One user was unsure what the difference was between email notifications and subscriptions. They did not understand how changing their subscriptions would affect the notifications they receive over email.

When asked if they could find a way to subscribe to new content, users were able to do this with ease by navigating to a piece of content and choosing the subscribe option in the top right. They felt this was a useful feature but wanted clarity on how this would impact their notification settings.

### Manager notifications

**Managers used a mixture of in-platform and email notifications, but had frustrations with the way these were delivered**

When it came to reviewing their own notifications, managers did this through a combination of emails and in-platform. They would typically use emails as an initial prompt to access the platform but then once signed some would see any further notifications from within the platform.

However two managers explained they can miss email notifications due to the high volume they receive. One suggested implementing browser notifications when signed in instead.

For managers there were frustrations around not being able to differentiate between notifications from the workspaces they were a member of vs. the ones they manage. They suggested having a filter to control this in-app.

One manager also felt it was frustrating to receive email notifications for all the changes they had personally made on the workspace. They wanted a way to turn off notifications from their own changes. It was unclear whether they had noticed or tried using the option available in Email Preferences.

One manager commented that the Private Messages function is a really useful feature. They had setup a suggestions and feedback call to action on their workspace homepage that directed any important messages to their email inbox.

## Wireframes - notifications

### Navigating & Initial impressions

**Users felt the notifications were very clear when arriving on the platform and generally thought these were well laid out**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84128097/123648886-3cc50f80-d821-11eb-81d9-8adf4b825be0.png)

Users were very quickly drawn to notifications when arriving on the Home page and explained these were much clearer than on the current platform. One member felt they would be less likely to rely solely on email notifications if they were this easy to see.

They felt it was clear they could view all notifications using the green arrow, so navigated to notifications with ease.

On the notifications page, users felt the notifications appeared clearly and the icons were useful in indicating what the notification was about. However, they still felt it could be clearer which workspace notifications were from.

Users did not naturally notice the colour coding of notifications and were unsure what this was for.

### Layout

**Although they liked the more visual layout, some felt the screen appeared too busy when workspace content was previewed**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84128097/123649030-5e25fb80-d821-11eb-89f9-4ba3e93d099c.png)

Users initially responded positively to the layout of the notifications page. They explained it was more visual and understood they would need to click on a notification to see it’s content in the main panel. 

Once clicking on this however, they were surprised to see the full workspace previewed in the panel. They explained they thought it would take them to a separate page with an option to return back to notifications when they were done.

Although it was useful to still see notifications down the right-hand side, they explained it made the screen appear very busy and instead there should be an option to minimise the list of notifications, or consider taking users to a separate page with a clear option to return.

One manager commented that they would expect to see notifications listed down the left rather than the right in a similar way to outlook.

### Managing notifications

**Users felt the options to manage notifications were useful and clear**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84128097/123649268-87468c00-d821-11eb-8cb8-9820c9040ef7.png)

Users noticed and liked the option to filter notifications. They particularly liked the options to filter by groups, allowing them to prioritise notifications most relevant to them. They could not think of any additional filters they’d want to see.

They felt it was useful to be able to action certain notifications from the notifications page using the calls to action as this was much easier than navigating to another page.

Users felt it was clear how to manage notifications using the option at the top of the page, and felt the language, icon and location made this much easier to find than on the current platform.

Users understood they could manage individual notifications using the ellipses icon and felt the options within this were useful.

### Comparison (Wireframes VS Kahootz)

**Users preferred the wireframes to the current platform with regards to viewing and managing notifications**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84128097/123649435-a6ddb480-d821-11eb-8e9a-738b60ef0fbf.png)

Overall, users preferred the wireframes as a way to view and manage notifications as they felt visually options were more noticeable making it easier to navigate.

They likened its layout to social media platforms like Facebook, and felt the familiarity made it straightforward to use.
