## Typologies

**Typologies are frameworks that describe different types of users at a high level.**

Typologies are based on user experience research — what users think, do and use:

- think — their points of pain and expectations
- do — who they are, what roles they play, how they play these roles
- use — tools, technology, interactions


**Typologies and personas are closely aligned.**

The typology provides user experience information at an overview level.
Personas take that information and bring the typologies to life with scenarios and storytelling.

## Personas

## Amari - The Active Collaborator ##

" If I hear about new tools to save time, I’m always keen to explore! "

Amari works for NHS East Lancashire Health Trust as a Communications and Engagement Officer. Currently the Trust is responsible for merging GP practices, paramedics, nurses, care coordinators and social prescribers. Amari mainly works in an office and occasionally from home.

Collaboration is key to their role. They like getting people together and actively seeks opportunities to chat to all staff members to pick their brains and get their feedback. However, Amari doesn't have the authority to setup new collaboration practices or do the decision-making, especially externally on a regional or national scale. They find it frustrating that everything needs to be signed off by at least 3 people before they can change anything.

**Internal Collaboration**

- Amari missed face to face meetings. Currently everything is digital & remote.​
- They’re part of a small team. Their immediate bubble consists of: them, a patient services manager, an external consultant (strong at branding) and a GP lead.​
- Amari is passionate about accessibility and recently attended a relevant webinar hosted on FutureNHS​
- They’ve heard of monday.com and would love to explore it​
- They’re sharing info regularly on MS Teams - has 'channels’ the they are responsible for- but also supports on 'general' channel​
  
**External Collaboration**

- Amari attends meetings within broader teams (admin, clinical etc.) weekly​
- There’s a monthly meeting with the whole PCN.​
- They are working with the local council, charities and university in regards to digital inclusion.​
- They use Social media (Facebook) to communicate information about their services with patients​
- Currently FutureNHS and PHE resource hub are their “go to” places for up to date information.​

**Collaboration Goals**

- Interact with other people and tap into their knowledge and ideas.​
- Use fun & innovative ways (ie. workshops) to interacting with their team and solving complex patients needs​
- Share patients’ feedback and needs with GPs to refine services for those in need - based on their 'lived experiences’​

**Pain Points**

- Online collaboration can become overwhelming (too easy and can be overused) so it makes you want to stop collaborating altogether​
- It’s challenging and time consuming to form clear outcomes agreed by everyone involved (differences in tech savviness, irrelevant information sharing)​
- Difficulty in collaborating with stakeholders who do not see benefits or have time to engage in collaborative activities​
- Things being shared at a national level are not always appropriate for - need attention to be relevant at a local level​
- Complex systems and lots of means to connect & communicate, and NHS not being clear on suitable strategy.​
- The large amount of information they have to go through and the updates they need everyday​
- Struggles with NHS jargon​

**Opportunities**

- Easier ways to collaborate – the current communication channels are not clear​
- Amari finds ICSs a very positive step – ICSs are encouraging collaboration outside immediate network (working with councils, charity groups, and other local healthcare providers)​
- Easy to access collaboration tools/platforms. ​
- More sharing on best practices and collaboration- are other PCNs going through a similar merging process like theirs?​
- More patient facing tools for engagement - Surveys, forums, threads​

**Quote**

" It is important to have the voice of patients and colleagues when making changes or improvements to services / policies / ways of working, for they are those that changes affect the most. For me it helps to have their words of understanding, especially for more complex issues in order to relay simple and clear messages internally and externally."


## Darra - The Collaboration Explorer ##

" I am new to collaborative ways of working so am just getting to grips with it. "

Darra works for the NHS Leeds CCG as a Digital Transformation Manager. They’re the driver of collaboration between organisations - bridging the gap between health, social care & local gov as part of developing an Integrated Care System in South West. Their team’s thinking is being shaped by the issues that their local population is facing. Darra is responsible for setting up practices and ways of working at mostly a regional level. They regularly report into NHSE Digital inclusion meetings and they’re a member of a digital champions community supporting more people to get online. Darra mainly works from home and goes in the office at Leeds once a week.

**Internal Collaboration**

- Darra meets with their team daily​
- Their team mainly uses MS teams and their internal drive to collaborate and share.​
- There’s a lot of project management in the CCG, which they find time consuming (they tend to apply more agile strategies).​
- Darra finds the face to face whiteboard collaboration sessions much easier than the online ones.​
- They use Miro and Google Jamboard, and virtual breakout rooms to collaborate.​

**External Collaboration**

- Darra speaks to other CCGs & orgs & public comms once a week ​
- They use verto to collaborate, a Project Management tool that anyone can access - no need for an nhs.net email​
- CCG is the conduit between orgs – Darra is responsible for ensuring everyone knows what each other is doing​
- On a regional level they’re the facilitator of collaboration - councils would not collaborate if they weren’t bringing everyone together as part of his role​

**Collaboration Goals**

- Collaboration is key to their ICS - they need to design systems that flow through organisations.​
- Make sure that there’s consistency when patients access care​
- Have buy in form all organisations to make sure priorities are aligned and adhered to​

**Pain Points**

- Hard to connect with people in other Trusts - email communication takes longer​
- Collaborating with local authorities is a new territory to explore​
- Some orgs are nervous about sharing data online, as they are unsure of security levels​
- It’s challenging to get all the right people to work together, especially with no face to face interaction​
- Get everybody to work as one organization from April 2022 - system integration to get local authorities and Trusts to know where to find all the right information​
- Ensure people with expertise and knowledge are brought into projects to ensure quality delivery​

**Opportunities**

- Sharing best practices among ICS would be very beneficial​
- NHS to promote collaboration as a priority​
- NHS to provide some case studies of examples of how to best organise ICSs​
- Darra thinks that FutureNHS is like Android: high customisation but low learnability. They’d like it to be more intuitive and easy to use.​
- Having an easy way to find, connect and share best practices with people across Trusts and other orgs​

**Quote**

" One of the main advantages to digital working is to be able to share data and create efficiency for staff and patients in entering each piece of data once only. This needs to be done collaboratively."


## Alex - The Collaborative Decision Maker ##

"I'm quite new to these technologies…I'm not a digital native, I'm a digital immigrant"

Alex works for East Sussex County Council as a mental health (MH) practitioner and trainer. They overlook training and coordinate placements of MH practitioners. Their responsibilities also include improvement of practices, ways of working, and MH services by sharing information, collaborating and training the next gen of MH professionals. Alex regularly links up with non government organisations (NGO) and organizes big conferences with professional leads on a national level. They are active on Twitter primarily to network with local, regional, and national figures, and are involved in 'Being digital project' working with project leads to improve access to tech for MH practitioners. They used to work daily at a clinical setting, but after the pandemic they work from home.


**Internal Collaboration**

- Alex is the driver in collaboration in her internal team, but feels that collaboration practices are now well established so they can take a back seat - 5/6 years had to establish and wave flag for Mental Health practitioners & social care, and built good relationships.​
- Monitors apprentices weekly on online MS Teams meetings​
- Picks up what's going on by speaking to others in local team meetings once a week more informally, and once a month more formally.​

**External Collaboration**

- At a national level, Alex is funnelling information from key sources and contacts to the local Mental Health practitioners.​
- Alex helped to setup the ICS in Sussex - interested in fuelling and then letting it happen​
- Messenger of information from NHS to Local authorities especially around best working practices- checking out what's going on FutureNHS​
- Collaborate with heads in other councils - usually connected through word of mouth, or Twitter - share resources & working practices​
- Uses the Mental Health newsletter and Twitter to invite key national speakers to the Conferences they organise​

**Collaboration Goals**

- Take different ideas and get the enthusiasm going​
- Better understand front line's experiences and needs​
- Understand what the new policies are and connect with experts to tap into their knowledge​
- Learn from other people’s successes and failures, and translate back to their team​

**Pain Points**

- There’s not enough people -and therefore time for collaboration- in charities and community groups where day to day work takes place ​
- More time is spent on looking for funding & staff resourcing and less on patients’ priorities​
- Different working culture between Local authorities and NHS​
- Different budgets and funding & disjointed systems make collaboration harder​
- Digital exclusion and insufficient Wifi coverage​
- Technical jargon in meetings in a barrier​
- Slow decision making due to disjointed systems​

**Opportunities**

- Find ways to align different working culture between Local authorities and NHS​
- Making sure that the patient needs are central when it comes to decision making​
- Ensuring all content and systems are accessible ​
- An integrated approach- streamlined work across health care​

**Quote**

" I am aware that cross system working is known to reduce health inequalities. As a social care practitioner I am often disappointed at the siloed approach amongst health care professionals. Collaboration usually involves shared solutions to intractable problems including providing services to marginalised communities."

## Eli - The Collaborative Decision Maker ##

"I sit in the centre of the architectural view, I can't do my job without understanding what the business and its people are doing"

Eli works for the NHS as Head of Digital Infrastructure. They’re looking at promoting standard architecture and make sure it is followed. Bringing teams together & making sure people are collaborating. Although not part of their job, Eli chooses to collaborate with the broader Health & Social care sector & local gov as they think it can be beneficial to everyone involved. Eli mostly works from home and collaborates remotely with various stakeholders on both a regional and national level. Understanding the business needs and deciding on the most appropriate technology to support is at the core of their role.

**Internal Collaboration**

- They meet multiple times a week with the Information governance, cyber security, and records management teams.​
- Eli needs to work with various suppliers and vendors on a daily basis​
- They attend meetings at the early stage of a project, giving advice to guide them to the right direction - telling them if they need architect onboard (after that they have less involvement)​
- They use a variety of apps for collaboration and file sharing, such as Mural to sketch maps for showing system interdependence, MS planner to track tasks, and MS one note for personal notes​

**External Collaboration**

- Eli helps people go through the governance process of IT​
- On a national level they are a key player in collaboration to help improve architecture​
- Eli sometimes just dips in and keeps an eye on what's going on and gives suggestions E.g. specific projects or national programmes  in the wider Health & Social care sector and UK Government.​
_ Some of the apps they use for collaboration and file sharing: Github to set up a collaboration area to share with some of the vendors, Mural to simplify and share complex system mapping, FutureNHS to dip into conversations & contribute to discussions​

**Collaboration Goals**

- Provide great value and benefits to the organization, the sector and the Government as a whole​
- Coordinate on their approach with other lead architects and cyber security experts across the health sector and Government​
- Collaborate with agencies and vendors​
- Be efficient and make good use of the public purse​
- The organisation can’t work without IT- it’s Eli’s responsibility to understand the business needs, and support with the appropriate technology​

**Pain Points**

- A lot of NHS systems don’t communicate with each other​
- Having to deal with people who think they know IT better than the IT team​
- Wrong peoples' understanding of free tools – even if a tool is free it still takes up resource to setup & govern and there’s not enough resources for that​
- Having to invest a lot of daily time to help people that deal with technical issues​

**Opportunities**

- There’s still work to be done to be able to share the authorization across NHS and with the other organizations. Currently pockets of work are being done but they’re siloed.
- Ensure business people understand IT isn't free – it takes time and money to set up​
- NHSE&I needs to simplify the IT structure and move everyone to a common platform​
- NHSE&I to align culture, processes and strategy to inform the ‘bigger picture’​

**Quote**

" Deciding on the best platform remains challenging always. We are working internally to standardise and consolidate but when colleagues can go off and start using cloud collaboration services without any oversight it becomes all too easy for security and privacy to get left behind."


## Ray - The Sceptical Collaborator ##

"I feel guilty when I miss a workshop with the regional teams. I feel that I ought to be more involved"

Ray works for the NHS North Yorkshire Trust as a Consultant Occupational Health (OH) Physician. They are a clinical lead for OH guidance for employers and managers regarding 'interaction between health and work’. Ray is new to collaboration and they mainly collaborate on a local level, but they started having some minimal national involvement. They recently took part in an educational conference organised by Health Education England. Ray is office based at a clinical setting and believes that their role cannot be done remotely. They try to have their meetings face to face as much as possible, but using Teams occasionally has worked quite well. Part of their latest responsibilities has been improving their services through collaboration. Collaborative decision making was initially out of their comfort zone, but after some teething problems it worked well. Ray can see the value in collaborating but they often struggle to find the time and the most efficient way to do so.

**Internal Collaboration**

- They mostly meet face to face with her immediate bubble, and on MS Teams with the wider team 2-3 times a week​
- They have a shared drive for their team and another shared with HR - for risk assessments and absence figures​
- There is a senior clinicians whatsapp group – Ray has limited engagement but it’s useful to see what people are talking about​
- They prefer to use their mobile phone, because of better connection compared to the landline from the Trust​
- The Trust has a facebook page - predominantly used for staff queries related to shifts, parking, complaints, etc., but Comms team have got more involved putting out surveys and videos recently​

**External Collaboration**

- Ray is involved in a regional training programme - communication and sharing information across trusts as a response to a recent crisis. It was new and worked really well​
- Collaboration goals are set externally and external staff has been brought in to facilitate​
- They communicate once a week on a regional level for various issues via email​
- National NHSE programme to look at working better across Occupational Health. Four different Trusts part of new scheme/workshop​
- They held weekly regional meetings across different Trusts during the start of the pandemic, and there’s willingness to do more of this​
- Ray takes part in a peer support group of 6 people on an ad hoc basis​

**Collaboration Goals**

- Make everyone -HR, health and safety, executive directors-  aware of urgent vulnerable population needs​
- Include members of the team in process changes - making multi-disciplinary decisions​
- Understand more people’s positions, because it leads to better solutions​

**Pain Points**

- Hard to share learnings across Trusts, as resource & efforts vary– “Only 1 doctor in this service, one 'up the road' has 8 Doctors…different structural issues mean limited capacity to share learning, and it means that processes have to be different”​
- Bring people in for collaboration can be risky. Ray worries that some people are not able to engage, or able to compromise when needed​
- Occupational Health (OH) is misunderstood and it’s "pushed around a little bit" as a result​
- OH world is "very commercial" and therefore there’s often a competition element ​
- Ray is willing to share but finds it quite hard to work out what's appropriate for sharing and with whom​
- Changing processes and ways of working has been difficult – “a lot of conflict if truly honest’” Pandemic has magnified these challenges​


**Opportunities**

- There are lots of people that Ray have never been in the room with and they need to find ways –or learn from others- how to create relationships online, especially in a post pandemic future where no chatter or corridor conversations are there to add value​
- Occupational health maybe very commercial and there’s keen competition - but could be doing more to improve e.g benchmarking, looking at how others do things​
- Doctors could get together more for service design within the NHS​
- Find workspaces of interest easily on FutureNHS​

**Quote**

" Time, energy, motivation and priority lists are all barriers to collaboration. It requires a lot of energy to explain the value of occupational health and dealing with all the misconceptions and negative personal experiences of others"


## Jo - The Content Consumer ##

"We are not regularly invited to the table to share our problem-solving skills or contribute in the decision making processes that ultimately affect us and our work environment"

Jo is a children’s community nurse at the Belfast NHS Trust. Jo works with children with palliative conditions including cancer and they strive as a team to prevent hospital admission and promote early discharge. They work closely as a team internally and they mostly have their meetings face to face. Their manager has recommended a collaboration platform for their team to use, so that they can connect and learn from other Trusts and share any learnings they have. External collaboration is on the horizon –with ICSs- but they do not feel confident or well equipped for it yet, and worry that it may slow them down.

**Collaboration Goals**

- Share expertise with other community nurses to exchange information and ideas resulting in better performance and patient care quality ​
- Understand what other teams are doing to reduce duplication and increase efficiency​
- Better team working, shared responsibility and delegation​

**Pain Points**

- Collaboration outside own team seems to disrupt more critical tasks ​

- To get quick access to relevant information to make their work more effective / efficient​
- Mobile friendly platforms to access from own devices​
- Having management support and making time to learn about collaboration best practices​
- See more nurses on the collaboration platforms taking part in discussions, to enhance confidence in contributing​

**Quote**

" I think we need a dummy's guide for how the different collaborative tools interact. Think I definitely need a detailed map, and also think I am not alone."​
