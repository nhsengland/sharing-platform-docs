## Typologies

**Typologies are frameworks that describe different types of users at a high level.**

Typologies are based on user experience research — what users think, do and use:

- think — their points of pain and expectations
- do — who they are, what roles they play, how they play these roles
- use — tools, technology, interactions


**Typologies and personas are closely aligned.**

The typology provides user experience information at an overview level.
Personas take that information and bring the typologies to life with scenarios and storytelling.

## Personas

**Amari - The Active Collaborator**

" If I hear about new tools to save time, I’m always keen to explore! "

Amari works for NHS East Lancashire Health Trust as a Communications and Engagement Officer. Currently the Trust is responsible for merging GP practices, paramedics, nurses, care coordinators and social prescribers. Amari mainly works in an office and occasionally from home.

Collaboration is key to their role. They like getting people together and actively seeks opportunities to chat to all staff members to pick their brains and get their feedback. However, Amari doesn't have the authority to setup new collaboration practices or do the decision-making, especially externally on a regional or national scale. They find it frustrating that everything needs to be signed off by at least 3 people before they can change anything.​

| **Internal Collaboration** | **External Collaboration** |
|--------------------------- |:--------------------------:|
|Amari missed face to face meetings. Currently everything is digital & remote. They’re part of a small team. Their immediate bubble consists of: them, a patient services manager, an external consultant (strong at branding) and a GP lead. Amari is passionate about accessibility and recently attended a relevant webinar hosted on FutureNHS. They’ve heard of monday.com and would love to explore it. They’re sharing info regularly on MS Teams - has 'channels’ the they are responsible for- but also supports on 'general' channel | Amari attends meetings within broader teams (admin, clinical etc.) weekly. There’s a monthly meeting with the whole PCN. They are working with the local council, charities and university in regards to digital inclusion. They use Social media (Facebook) to communicate information about their services with patients. Currently FutureNHS and PHE resource hub are their “go to” places for up to date information. |
| **Collaboration Goals**    | **Pain Points**            |
| Interact with other people and tap into their knowledge and ideas. Use fun & innovative ways (ie. workshops) to interacting with their team and solving complex patients needs Share patients’ feedback and needs with GPs to refine services for those in need - based on their 'lived experiences’ | Online collaboration can become overwhelming (too easy and can be overused) so it makes you want to stop collaborating altogether. It’s challenging and time consuming to form clear outcomes agreed by everyone involved (differences in tech savviness, irrelevant information sharing). Difficulty in collaborating with stakeholders who do not see benefits or have time to engage in collaborative activities. Things being shared at a national level are not always appropriate for - need attention to be relevant at a local level. Complex systems and lots of means to connect & communicate, and NHS not being clear on suitable strategy. The large amount of information they have to go through and the updates they need everyday. Struggles with NHS jargon. |
| **Opportunities**          | **Quote**                  |
| Easier ways to collaborate – the current communication channels are not clear. Amari finds ICSs a very positive step – ICSs are encouraging collaboration outside immediate network (working with councils, charity groups, and other local healthcare providers). Easy to access collaboration tools/platforms. More sharing on best practices and collaboration- are other PCNs going through a similar merging process like theirs? More patient facing tools for engagement - Surveys, forums, threads | It is important to have the voice of patients and colleagues when making changes or improvements to services / policies / ways of working, for they are those that changes affect the most. For me it helps to have their words of understanding, especially for more complex issues in order to relay simple and clear messages internally and externally. |

" I am new to collaborative ways of working so am just getting to grips with it. "
