# FutureNHS Migration - 1st & 2nd February 2022

## User Research Overview

### Migration Research Aim
- To begin discussing the migration experience with workspace managers to gather user needs, potential pain points, and opportunities to help shape and prepare for migration

### Persona validation & User / workspace background
- Role in the NHS / related organisation & how they collaborate as part of their role to identify persona group
- Current use of the platform

### Migration
- Needs and opportunities around migration
- Perceived risks or considerations
- Expectations around migration

### Experience Mapping
- Walking through the known experience for migration to understand specific needs, pain points or opportunities at each stage

### Reviewing 2.0 Workspace
- Demoing a 2.0 version of their workspace based on existing functionality to understand readiness and needs ahead of migration

## Methodology
For this round of research we used a remote moderated one-to-one user research methodology.
The sessions were conducted via video conference and screen sharing on Teams, and participants joined from their desktop.
The moderator and participant could see and hear each other in order to conduct the interview.
The moderator shared their screen to demonstrate the experience map on miro, as well as the 2.0 version of the participants’ workspace. Interview questions were asked throughout to understand natural responses, concerns and opportunities.

## Manager and Workspace Background

- 5 Managers took part in research from 3 different workspaces:
  - Veterans Trauma Network (Pioneer or Phoenix)
  - North West Regional Retention Channel (Pioneer)
  - Methods (Pioneer)

## Migration Needs and Expectations

### Essential Functionality

#### Files and folders were priority, plus signposting features

- For most, existing workspaces were used as a file repository so files and folder were the bare minimum they would need to migrate
- Some also emphasised the importance of being able to signpost to anything ‘new’ or ‘external’ so mentioned the use of carousels, latest news and web links
