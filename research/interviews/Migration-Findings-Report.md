# FutureNHS Migration - 1st & 2nd February 2022

## User Research Overview

### Migration Research Aim
- To begin discussing the migration experience with workspace managers to gather user needs, potential pain points, and opportunities to help shape and prepare for migration

### Persona validation & User / workspace background
- Role in the NHS / related organisation & how they collaborate as part of their role to identify persona group
- Current use of the platform

### Migration
- Needs and opportunities around migration
- Perceived risks or considerations
- Expectations around migration

### Experience Mapping
- Walking through the known experience for migration to understand specific needs, pain points or opportunities at each stage

### Reviewing 2.0 Workspace
- Demoing a 2.0 version of their workspace based on existing functionality to understand readiness and needs ahead of migration

## Methodology
For this round of research we used a remote moderated one-to-one user research methodology.
The sessions were conducted via video conference and screen sharing on Teams, and participants joined from their desktop.
The moderator and participant could see and hear each other in order to conduct the interview.
The moderator shared their screen to demonstrate the experience map on miro, as well as the 2.0 version of the participants’ workspace. Interview questions were asked throughout to understand natural responses, concerns and opportunities.

## Manager and Workspace Background

- 5 Managers took part in research from 3 different workspaces:
  - Veterans Trauma Network (Pioneer or Phoenix)
  - North West Regional Retention Channel (Pioneer)
  - Methods (Pioneer)

## Migration Needs and Expectations

### Essential Functionality

#### Files and folders were priority, plus signposting features

- For most, existing workspaces were used as a file repository so files and folder were the bare minimum they would need to migrate
- Some also emphasised the importance of being able to signpost to anything ‘new’ or ‘external’ so mentioned the use of carousels, latest news and web links

### Opportunities from migration

#### Migration was seen as an opportunity to evolve or overhaul workspaces, and have early input into the new platform

- Some had evolving workspaces so saw early migration as an opportunity to evolve with FutureNHS, ensuring tech is up to date and avoiding duplication of setup effort at a later stage
- If they were a more established workspace, then this was seen as an opportunity to review the content and have an overhaul 
- Some were keen to be a part of the evolution of the new platform and provide feedback – particularly those with workspaces spanning NHS and non-NHS workforces
- Some hoped that the new platform would provide a better user experience with increased functionality, better look and feel and be more user friendly
- For managers who were part of a larger community of workspaces, it was seen as a good opportunity to test migration on a smaller workspace and iron out any teething problems before following with larger workspaces

### Perceived risks or concerns

#### Some had concerns over loss of content or unfamiliarity for users, but overall felt the risks were low

- Some were anxious about content being lost or links being broken, but stated they had confidence the FutureNHS team would make sure the new platform was stable beforehand
- Some wondered how much effort the migration process would involve and hoped it would be a ‘lift and shift’ without too much admin
- Concerns were raised around the impact on the user base if they are unfamiliar with the new platform. They felt this may make it less accessible and unfamiliar to navigate, therefore reducing usage
- Overall, concerns and risks were low as these workspaces were relatively small with low usage, but managers acknowledged risks would be much greater on larger workspace

### Existing understanding and expectations around migration

#### Users expected an improved look and feel, more capability and good comms and support from the FutureNHS team

Users felt migrating to the new platform would offer a better look and feel, which is more NHS-y and aesthetically pleasing​

Some noted that they expected it to have more capability​

- In terms of the migration process, most expected it to happen via the push of a button
- Managers hoped to have a couple of weeks notice to prepare content and decide what they want transferring over, and also to let members know in case anything will be unavailable during the transition period
- They would expect support to be available from FutureNHS as they prepare to migrate
- Whilst all managers were open to change and saw this as an opportunity for improvements, they acknowledged that some of their community may be more resistant which means communication is key to set expectations

## Responses to 2.0 workspaces & Overall comments on migration

### Concerns, questions or missing features

#### A ‘what’s new’ section and live editing on files were considered missing features

- Managers felt that being able to update their members with ‘what’s new’ was key to engagement on their workspace. They wanted to create this signposting via a set of quick links or a carousel on the homepage.
- For some not having this functionality was a dealbreaker as they would not want to migrate without it
- One workspace wanted the ability to be able to live edit files without having to download them. In Kahootz they can edit on their own desktop, meanwhile it appears read only to others, then when they click save it saves back to the platform. This alleviates risk of duplication but can become a pain when collaborating on documents.
- Some asked whether they would be able to change the tabs available to navigate the workspace, feeling that this would be especially useful for larger workspaces.
- Some managers wanted to understand what training or support would be provided by the FutureNHS team and whether there would be a support desk available or they would be expected to self-serve.

### Overall response & Confidence migrating

#### Managers felt positively towards 2.0 and confident migrating

- Managers felt visually the new platform looks great and more in-line with NHS design standards, making it feel familiar and more corporate
- They felt tabs were a better way to signpost and navigate rather than having to create links on the homepage
- Overall, managers felt fairly confident migrating to the new platform based on what they had seen
- They explained they had always received organised and efficient communication from the FutureNHS team so had confidence the process would be managed well
