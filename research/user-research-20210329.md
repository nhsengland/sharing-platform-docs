# FutureNHS User Research 29 April 2021

## Objective
The focus of this user research was to speak with users of the current [FutureNHS collaboration platform](https://future.nhs.uk/) with to understand:
- their role and current use of the platform
- their thoughts on it, including asny barriers or frustrations
- what other tools and platforms they used for collaboration.

We asked them to undertake activities on the current platform to understand:
- how they would usually get started
- their use of user dashboard
- how they discover content and workspaces

We also used this research to gather research on wireframes for a new FutureNHS product on:
- initial designs for the User dashboard (‘Home’), Workspace dashboard (‘Group dashboard’) and ‘Find a Group’.

## Methodology
For this round of research we used a remote moderated one-to-one user research methodology. The sessions were conducted via video conference and screen sharing meeting on Teams, and participants joined from their desktop. The moderator and participant could see and hear each other in order to conduct the interview. Chat functionality allowed the moderator to provide instructions, and links to the wireframes. Participants accessed the platform & wireframes on their desktop and shared their screen. The moderator was able to see the participant’s screen and used concurrent think aloud (CTA) to understand their behaviour and asked interview questions

## User background
We interviewed 2 platform members and 3 platform managers in total. All participants used the platform at least weekly (often more). 

The main use of the members were:
- view and edit documents
- learn & gather information for a report 

and for workspace managers
- sharing files
- sharing and managing content
- connecting users via forums.

Other tool our users used for their work included Email, Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, Yammer, Blackboard

## Findings

### Current use of the platform 
Core use varies by workspace, and also role e.g. member or manager

Core use varied by workspace:
- A ‘super-file structure’ to manage, store, edit and access information and documents
- A networking tool to discuss & discover relevant topics within a certain field
- A combination of accessing content & networking – some strived for this combination with integration between discussion forums and documents.

Members use the platform to learn or contribute – viewing and downloading content
- One member whose workspace was used as a file collaboration tool, also edited shared documents.

Managers use the platform to facilitate learning and sharing - updating their workspace, adding new content and starting discussions.

Compared to other tools and platforms, the advantage of FutureNHS was cross-organisational collaboration, the page builder functionality & forums (not available in Teams / Sharepoint).

### Thoughts on the current platform
Overall thoughts on the platform were positive. Users referred to it as ‘useful’ and ‘easy to use’.

#### What works well
*Members*
- Dedicated space for information & resources specific to me
- Understand best practice / what else is happening in my area.

*Managers*
- Version control - only one user can access a document at a time
- Forum a successful way to bring people into one space.

#### Barriers & Frustrations / Improvements
*Members*
- Not always intuitive / can be confusing to navigate, feels like ‘lots of layers’ to get to what you need, especially for those less digitally savvy
- Can get lost in a workspace, then makes it difficult to ‘re-find’ things – would be useful to save or bookmark content.

*Managers*
- Difficult to find new features and corresponding setup info
- Suggestion of onboarding information for members & managers
- Desire for user & workspace dashboards to have some standardisation
- Reporting and auditing on workspaces is difficult – would like a ‘manager dashboard’ to see performance
- Flexibility on colours and imagery to make it feel ‘less corporate’
- Ability to integrate with other tools & platforms e.g. Teams
- Ability to quickly hide & share content e.g. toggle
- Improved notifications from forums

### Current use of user dashboard
**No users actively use the dashboard** on the current platform. They either quickly navigated to their workspaces from the top navigation or had bookmarked their workspace so bypassed the dashboard.

Users acknowledged if they were members of multiple workspaces, a central page may be useful. However, as most were regular users of a single workspace, the Workspace dashboard was considered a ‘homepage’ instead. 

When encouraged to review this page, most were unsure where content was coming from, particularly in ‘Recent Items’.

Most were unaware they could personalise their dashboard, explaining that as they did not use this page they had no real need or desire to do so.

Most felt the idea of ‘Recommended items’ matched to their interests was useful, though some questioned how relevant these were and thought there was a risk of feeling ‘bombarded’.

### Discovering content
Most would not actively go looking for new content or workspaces on the platform, and when they did, options to discover were unclear.

Most users explained they were unlikely to go looking for new content or workspaces as they were usually signposted or invited by someone else.

When asked to do see if there was a way to find new content or workspaces on the platform, most were drawn to the search bar on their dashboard or in the top navigation. Some did not realise the main search bar would only search within their workspace, but thought this became clear upon interaction.

Some were initially unsure how else to find content outside of their workspace as they missed the ‘Find a Workspace’ in the left hand nav of their dashboard.
- Users suggested also having this visible when within workspaces​
- Another suggested using the user dashboard as a place to list categories / encourage exploration of workspaces.

As there were a lot of workspaces available, some suggested adding filters to narrow down workspaces by topic area or recency of activity.
- One users missed the search bar.

A manager suggested providing standardised preview information to better outline workspace details & content.

## Feedback on new protoypes

**Please note** *these are not the final designs, just early ideas to get feedback from users. We are also undertaking a separate branding exercise, so until this is complete we are reusing the existing collaboration platform's design as a placeholder*

### Initial impressions of ideas for new product look and feel
Most users preferred the look and feel and layout of the wireframes, though one user had concerns about introducing change.

Most users’ initial impressions of the wireframes were positive:
- Most preferred the general look and feel explaining the use of colour made it seem more inviting
- Users preferred the general layout and designs explaining everything seemed easily accessible and more intuitive.

One user thought the wireframes felt less personal and ‘more NHSy’, explaining they preferred what they were used to. They felt the platform being useful and usable was more important than looks.

This user also felt uncomfortable about a new platform. They explained if they had to start from scratch and recreate their workspace they would move to Teams instead. They thought effort should be focused on making the current platform better instead.

Two users were unsure about the use of ‘Groups’ and explained they thought ‘Workspaces’ better described what these are.

### User dashboard
Users responded positively to the layout and design of the user dashboard.

On the user dashboard, users responded well to the ‘Feed’, explaining it emulated Facebook & LinkedIn as a more discussion-based page.

Some mentioned the use of tabs as a useful way to navigate between content.

One user particularly liked the use of imagery and profile photos, helping the platform to feel less corporate.

Users had a mixed response to the feed being populated with recommended content. Whilst it could be useful, some though there was a risk of it being irrelevant and feeling like an overload of information.

Users felt it was very clear how to navigate to their groups, using the left-hand navigation.

### Group dashboard
Most users liked the visual design and functions available on the workspace dashboard.

Most users responded positively to the Workspace dashboard as an initial entry screen to their workspace:
- Users felt it was ‘better to look at’ visually
- And noted that key functions such as Discussions, Members and Pages were easily accessible, both from the tabs and on-page calls to action.

### Navigation & Discoverability of Content
Most users preferred the sticky left hand panel as a way to navigate the platform & some had difficulty finding new content.

*Navigation*
When it came to navigating the platform, most users preferred having the sticky left hand navigation panel, explaining this was easier than navigating between ‘My dashboard’ and ‘My workspaces’ to access different functionality.

One workspace manager raised concerns over screen width because of the navigation panel, and questioned whether the panel would reflect workspace themes or visual settings such as ‘dark mode’.

*Discoverability of content*
Some users initially missed the ‘Find a group’ option when looking for a way to find new content or workspaces. They suggested changing the heading to ‘Other’ or ‘All groups’ to make it clear these were different to their own groups. 

On the ‘Find a group’ page some users were unsure how the checkboxes would work, whether these were independent of the search box or a way to narrow down search results.

One user thought these were the same as the ‘Areas of interest’ in their profile so were confused as to why they were displayed here and how they would impact search. They suggested labelling them ‘Topics’ instead.
