# FutureNHS Integrated Care System Discovery 

Working with FutureNHS, Nomensa have conducted a Discovery to better understand how to enhance FutureNHS platform capability to better support Integrated Care Systems (ICSs), both with internal collaboration and collaboration with other Integrated Care Systems.

## Objectives 

As part of this discovery, we conducted 18 user interviews with individuals from a range of roles working in ICSs across England.

The outcome of this project looked to answer the following objectives:

- How can FutureNHS support people working in ICSs to connect with other people inside and outside their ICS more easily?
- How can FutureNHS make it easier for ICSs to manage and coordinate events through FutureNHS?
- How can FutureNHS support ICSs to collaborate with their stakeholders and one another more efficiently?

## High-level Findings 

| Topic        | Key Finding           | Detail  |
| :-------------: |:-------------| :-----|
| ICS Structure and Maturity      | Organisations are undergoing a period of intense change | As a result of ICS transition, there is a wide variety of organisation structures across roles, collaboration, digital and regions - these will continue to evolve significantly over the next year. Handling organisation attitudes to system level working will be a challengeduring this period of change. |
|| Levels of maturity are varied across ICSs | Levels of maturity surrounding digital, collaboration and region are varied. Some of the challenges that underpin these surroundemployee technical skills, too many digital tools and scepticism around change. |
|General Needs and Challenges of ICSs | A smooth transition to system level collaboration is the priority | The most significant goal surrounds handling the current period of transition and transformation as smoothly as possible. This is with hope to set the foundation for working across system level to help contribute towards better population health outcomes.
|| Uncertainty around how ICSs will look and function is a consistent concern | People are generally unsure around which direction ICSs are heading to in terms of governance, organisation structure and andways of working. This could impact collaborative efforts when considered alongside other concerns such as digital maturity.|
|Working Inside the ICS| Individuals work with many teams inside their ICS system | There is abundant team-to-team contact within their own ICS structures - how often, why and who they interact with is dependent on role. |
|| Working around other organisations’priorities can be difficult | The biggest challenges for people working in their own system include working around the priorities of other organisations and attitudes towards collaboration. This impacts organisations being able to align goals and work together at a system level. |
|| Teams work together across many activities and tools | Teams inside their own ICS will take part in activities from organised training to informal meetings. They use a range of tools to support these activities, with a reliance on core communication and collaboration tools which are unlikely to change significantly.|
|Working Outside the ICS| Working with others outside their own ICS is active | Nearly all participants have worked with others outside of their ICS to some degree, and there is good motivation to want to do so more often. Collaboration is most active with neighbouring ICSs, as programmes of work can sometimes overlap with bordering places.
|| Working together outside of the ICS can be restricted by attitudes to change and technology | Some organisations are more difficult to work with as they do not like to deviate far from ‘how they run things’. Working together can be made even more challenging by a reliance on existing processes, budgets and solutions to achieve local system goals.|
|| Working activities and tools used do not differ largely from inside-ICS working | The working activities and tools that people use to work with others outside of their ICS do not generally differ largely to those used to work with their immediate team. |
|Connecting and Networking|One-to-one connection is supported by preferred core tools| People prefer core tools for one-to-one connection that have supported them throughout the pandemic, and often reference the relevance and delivery of notifications as significant to success in connecting (for example, use of day-to-day tools such as email and MS Teams).|
||Group connection often has involvement from senior roles| Formed via senior ICS leaders, group connection often takes the form of professional working groups. These contain those in the same role, or different roles working on similar projects across ICSs in order to share best practice (for example, Lead Communications and Engagement Managers from different organisations regularly meeting to coordinate programme priorities).|
||Networking is considered valuable, and people actively take part|There is an active desire to network, and many participants make use of networking tools (such as LinkedIn). Key benefits of networking is sharing best practices and learnings both at system and regional level. |
|Collaborating|Interactive tools with good functionality are often preferred for collaboration|People enjoy collaborating when core tools are available that are interactive and offer good functionality. They are used to support a variety of activities that rely on encouraging engagement to get the best outcomes. For example, document editing tools provided by MS 365 are widely adopted, as well as collaborative whiteboards such as Miro.|
||Schedules and organisation priorities are barriers to collaboration|Coordinating programmes of work at a system level is often challenging due to difficulties aligning schedules and organisational priorities.|
||The attitudes and perceived benefits of collaboration across the system are generally very positive|Despite some difficulties, nearly every participant saw collaboration as vital to their role, in addition to the agreed impact that collaboration brought to the success of projects.|
|Running and Attending Events| Events range in purpose, attendance size and include professionals from the health and social care sector | Events range from programme level training at a system level to national webinars and talks. Event attendance size ranges from 4 to 4000 people, and more often targets a professional audience over the general public.|
||Events are nearly all digital and cover all levels of scale | Events have become increasingly digital since the start of the pandemic, but there are still divided preferences between physical and digital events. They cover a variety of topics and operate from team up to national scale.|
|| Events are supported by a variety of tools from start to finish | Tools such as Eventbrite and Mentimeter are popular in supporting organisation of attendees and engagement during the event, while the most popular follow-up tool was Google forms. |
|| There are some concerns around event security | Virtual events pose some security concerns around secure link sharing and monitoring of attendee activity, while the balance between physical and digital events can be hard to manage as the pandemic improves. |
