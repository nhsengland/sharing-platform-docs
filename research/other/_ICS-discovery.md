# FutureNHS Integrated Care System Discovery 

Working with FutureNHS, Nomensa have conducted a Discovery to better understand how to enhance FutureNHS platform capability to better support Integrated Care Systems (ICSs), both with internal collaboration and collaboration with other Integrated Care Systems.

## Objectives 

As part of this discovery, we conducted 18 user interviews with individuals from a range of roles working in ICSs across England.

The outcome of this project looked to answer the following objectives:

- How can FutureNHS support people working in ICSs to connect with other people inside and outside their ICS more easily?
- How can FutureNHS make it easier for ICSs to manage and coordinate events through FutureNHS?
- How can FutureNHS support ICSs to collaborate with their stakeholders and one another more efficiently?

## High-level Findings 

| Topic        | Key Finding           | Detail  |
| ------------- |:-------------| :-----|
| ICS Structure and Maturity      | Organisations are undergoing a period of intense change | As a result of ICS transition, there is a wide variety of organisation structures across roles, collaboration, digital and regions - these will continue to evolve significantly over the next year. Handling organisation attitudes to system level working will be a challengeduring this period of change. |
|| Levels of maturity are varied across ICSs | Levels of maturity surrounding digital, collaboration and region are varied. Some of the challenges that underpin these surroundemployee technical skills, too many digital tools and scepticism around change. |
|General Needs and Challenges of ICSs | A smooth transition to system level collaboration is the priority | The most significant goal surrounds handling the current period of transition and transformation as smoothly as possible. This is with hope to set the foundation for working across system level to help contribute towards better population health outcomes.
|| Uncertainty around how ICSs will look and function is a consistent concern | People are generally unsure around which direction ICSs are heading to in terms of governance, organisation structure and andways of working. This could impact collaborative efforts when considered alongside other concerns such as digital maturity.|
