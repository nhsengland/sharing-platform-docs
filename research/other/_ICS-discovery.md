# FutureNHS Integrated Care System Discovery 

Working with FutureNHS, Nomensa have conducted a Discovery to better understand how to enhance FutureNHS platform capability to better support Integrated Care Systems (ICSs), both with internal collaboration and collaboration with other Integrated Care Systems.

## Objectives 

As part of this discovery, we conducted 18 user interviews with individuals from a range of roles working in ICSs across England.

The outcome of this project looked to answer the following objectives:

- How can FutureNHS support people working in ICSs to connect with other people inside and outside their ICS more easily?
- How can FutureNHS make it easier for ICSs to manage and coordinate events through FutureNHS?
- How can FutureNHS support ICSs to collaborate with their stakeholders and one another more efficiently?
