# Notifications  

## What is this? 

A feature of FutureNHS (FNHS), whereby managers and members are updated regarding changes to the platform â€“ made by other users of the platform and related to the platform itself. Research and design work relating to this feature was initially carried out to understand how users interacted with notifications issued by and within the original Kahootz platform. This was conducted as a means of translating this experience and learnings into the new platform. Research was conducted with users at two different stages to test updated designs. 


## Current status 

**Status:** ðŸŸ  

Designs were completed for FNHS 2.0 notifications page with different iterations tested with users to determine where notifications should be displayed.   


Overall designs for the new platform were liked with a preference for having a single page where all notifications could be viewed. Some participants suggested they may be less dependent on email if this was available. 


Designs were not implemented into the product.

## Recommendations 

### Short term (in Kahootz) 


* Users are generally unaware of how they can manage their notifications settings and so work should be done to increase the visibility of this feature. A link to this page should be more apparent to users on their summary email and the location of this page should be reviewed in light of related user journeys. 

* Research suggests that users often feel overwhelmed by the amount of notifications. Testing suggests that adding filters to the notification list page would allow users greater control as to what updates they see and how often they see them. 

* Email notifications are regarded as an important method of re-engaging users and informing them of change within their workspaces. Improvements could be made to the layout of these emails and the information provided within them, to make them easier to consume and of greater relevance to users.  

* Emails sometimes go to junk by default. Some users have reported not getting emails from priority workspaces or getting them from workspaces they did not need notifications for. More investigation into this issue could be helpful. 



### Long term 

* Use existing FNHS 2.0 patterns as a base for any ongoing design work.  

* In combination with conventional best practice around how to best inform users of updates on the platform. 

* Any new implementation of notifications should include a single page to see all updates, with the ability to sort and filter.

## What we did 

### Kahootz Research 

- [9 June 2021](/research/interviews/user-research-20210609.md) - Interviews on use of **permissions** and **notifications**

* Analysis of usage data   

* Review of related support desk tickets  



 

### FNHS 2.0 Research 

- [11 February 2022](/research/interviews/user-research-20220214.md) - Research and prototype testing on use of **notifications**

- [April 2022](/research/surveys/notifications-april22.md) - Survey to validate user needs, collect preferences and obtain feedback on Kahootz **updates** and **notifications**

### Designs

## Insights 
**Insight 1:** Updates should be **relevant** 

Users should be quickly able to view and access the relevant information using deep links direct to information and actions that need to be completed i.e. within email and notifications section/s on the platform. 

To minimise effort. Users do not want to have to work at finding and actioning things. 


**Evidence:** Survey and interviews, wireframes and design concepts 

**User needs** 

There are multiple user needs from our list that are relevant to this insight such as: 

 
> As a member I need to know about job critical updates e.g. if somebody has replied to an urgent question or request that I posted so that I can review and action the information straight away 


> As a member I need to see a summary of what is new/has been changed on my workspace so that I can decide whether I need to go and look at it 

 

--- 

**Insight 2:** Updates should be **timely** 

Users need to know the right information at the right time - immediately if urgent, once a week (or other as specified) if for general interest. 

To maximise usefulness and efficiencies. Make the most of the platform and enable users to manage their work effectively.  

 

**Evidence** Survey and Interviews 

 

**User needs** 

 

> As a member I need to know about job critical updates e.g. if somebody has replied to an urgent question or request that I posted so that I can review and action the information straight away 

 

> As a member I need a timely nudge to tell me if something is critical so that I donâ€™t have to keep checking the platform 

 

> As a member I need to know if there is something I have to do on the platform so that others can get on with their jobs 

 

> As a member I need to know in advance if the platform is going to be unavailable so that I can plan my work effectively 


**Areas to explore** 

Further analysis of notification types to explore which ones are often responded to and which are dismissed, further maximising the usefulness. 

**Challenges** 

Understanding the conflicting needs of Managers and Members when sending notifications is a challenge. Both groups have different priorities which may align or conflict, but do add a level of complexity to what updates users need based on role.

**Insight 3:** Updates should be **controllable**  

Users should be able to switch specific notifications on and off so they donâ€™t get overwhelmed with updates and feel in control of their information and media. 

To minimise frustration. Make it easier to find things of most importance and relevance 

 

**Evidence:** Survey and interviews, wireframes and design concepts 

**User needs** 

> As a member I need to receive updates on the topics I am interested in so that I can stay informed 

> As a workspace manager I need to receive regular updates about what has changed on my workspaces so that I can stay informed 

> As a member I need to have control over the number and manner of emails I am sent from the platform so that I can control my inbox and see updates that are important to me 

**Areas to explore**

How do workspace managers need to control their notification settings? Is this fundamentally different to regular members?  

**Challenges** 

Understanding the conflicting needs of managers and members when sending notifications is a challenge. Both groups have different priorities which may align or conflict, but do add a level of complexity to what updates users need based on role.

**Insight 4:** Updates should be **familiar**  

There are already several well known patterns for notifications and FutureNHS notifications should resemble them. 

To minimise learning effort. Updates are intuitive and work as expected 

**Evidence:** Survey and interviews, wireframes and design concepts  


**Areas to explore** 

Review previous design concepts against familiar social networks and establish common delta. Keep regularly in touch with latest trends and new innovations to understand whether any can be applied to the FutureNHS platform. 


**Challenges** 

Limitations as to what can be achieved within Kahootz and speed at which changes can be applied.
