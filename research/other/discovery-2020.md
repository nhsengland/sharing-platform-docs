# FutureNHS Platform Discovery

## Objectives

In 2020, the FutureNHS team undertook a platform discovery exercise. From this exercise we aimed to learn:
- Who the current and potential users of the platform are
- Why & how they use the platform
- What the most important features to our users are
- What we could or couldn’t migrate
- How we’ll measure future success
- What constraints we have

--- 

## Methods

### Qualitative Methods

#### Workspace managers survey
We surveyed 48 workspace managers with a 13 question (open field & multiple choice) questionnaire published on the platform's Workspace Managers Community. 

Our goals were to identify the primary job/goal that FutureNHS helps a user to achieve, ways in which the platform currently supports a user to achieve their jobs/goal, areas of opportunity for the new platform, 
areas to dive into more detail in qualitative interviews/contextual enquiry and find users to continue conducting research with.

#### User Interviews
We conducted 11 interviews with workspace managers and 1 with a workspace member via a 1hr video conference with screen share where possible.

Our goals were to understand the motivations for using FutureNHS, what jobs/goals using FutureNHS enables a user to achieve, how people use FutureNHS in more depth, any opportunity areas for FutureNHS and the context users are in when they use FutureNHS.

#### Teardowns
We reviewed 24 workspaces conducting usability analysis of workspace features and design against best design practices. 

Our goals were to understand current design patterns and root causes for issues.

#### Support ticket analysis
We analysed 530 ‘general query’ support tickets and categorised them by insight theme (e.g. “Users can't easily	create/edit/delete their own profile - *count = 86, 16.23%*)

Our goals were to identify where users experience issues with the platform and require extra-assistance from the service team.

### Quantitative Methods

#### Search Analysis
Search analysis was added to the Google Analytics property at the end of April. We reviewed the frequency of usage, content of searches and how they affected the usage of the product during the session that a user searched.

Our goal was to understand the usage of the feature and if there were any trends within search terms.

#### Feature usage Analysis
We took the top 5000 most popular pages from Google Analytics over a 3 month period, we reviewed the view counts of all feature types to understand how they ranked in terms of views and analysed how each workspace viewed features differently 

Our goal was to understand how much features are used and to look for further areas of analysis.

#### Widget usage Analysis
Analysis of the top ~4000 folders and their usage of page builder editor to add widgets to pages.

Our goal was to understand how the page builder was being used and whether it was needed or could be improved.

#### Workspace feature usage Analysis
Analysis of a small number of workspaces with certain usage habits from the Feature Usage Analysis to looking at what features they have created over time. 

Our goal was to understand if this analysis could be done to look at which workspaces would be most appropriate on the new platform.

## Who are the users of FutureNHS & why do they use the platform?

### User and stakeholder groups
The users of FutureNHS are either members, workspace managers or service team members. The Discovery research was primarily conducted with the workspace managers.
We conducted research mainly with Workspace Managers as we already had regular contact with them and during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic we made the decision not to unnecessarily contact general platform users.

#### User Profiles
A user can currently either be a member or a workspace manager.
 
We identified levels of maturity within these user types, that reflect the way a user primarily interacts with FutureNHS.

#### Personas
It is evident that, depending on their day-to-day role and responsibilities, a user will have a certain level of tech-savviness and tech-adoption.

#### Customer Segments
There are three main segments of customers for FutureNHS: national, regional and local groups.

### "Workspace Manager" Profiles
Using Google Analytics we learned that these users make up 17% of the **active users** on FutureNHS. 48 of these participated in a survey and a further 9 of these participated in interviews. 
37% of respondents in the survey were users who aligned with all or many of these profiles. 

They are made up of:

**Goal**: Provide a space to enable others to find, discuss and contribute to best practices

#### Administrator
**Representation**: 23 in survey, 9 in interviews
**Role**: Manages workspace permissions, teams, and process membership requests
**Goal**: Ensure the workspace and it’s content are up to date and viewed only by the people who should see it

---

### “Member” Profiles
These are the primary users of the FutureNHS, making up 83% of **active users** on the platform. 
A user may be a member in one workspace and a manager in another.

They are made up of:

#### Consumer
**Representation**: 2 interviews
**Role**: active members who make themselves visible in the workspace by asking a question or passive consumers who prefer to stay hidden
**Goal**: Find knowledge and best practices


#### Contributor
**Representation**: 23 in survey,1 interview
**Role**: active members who interact with consumers and workspace managers on the platform
**Goal**: Share thoughts/opinions on discussions about best practice or about the workspace

#### Advocator
**Representation**: 3 interviews
**Role**: Advocates the use of FutureNHS to others
**Goal**: Encourage others to make use of workspaces

---

### Personas behaviours
Broad behavioural strokes emerged from the user interviews

#### Tech-savviness

**Tech-savvy users**
Using technology daily at work, smoother onboarding and getting to grips with the current platform.

**Non Technical users**
Not using technology or platform in daily role, require additional personalised support.

#### Innovation adoption

**Ambassadors**
Early adopters of the platform, most often ambassadors and support for their team.

**Followers**
More dubious about subscribing to additional platforms, questioning the value, security, and ease of use.

### Workspace manager usage
Workspace managers use the platform and its features differently from members. 

#### Permissions
Workspaces tend to be segmented, through the use of the ‘teams’ permission to create public areas for consumers & contributors, and private areas for restricted access for workspace contributors and managers. 

#### Folders
Workspaces are primarily set up in 2 different ways, 
relying on folders differently: 
- **Repositories**, to share templated documents. Folder structure and naming is essential to ensure users find valuable content easily.
- **Webpages & Forums**, to share updates on national or local guidance, to foster collaboration and encourage community-building.

#### Widgets
Widget usage is high for some most used pages (most often homepages), as opposed to personal member dashboards which are rarely customised.

Without adequate training or guidelines, confusing layouts can bury content.

## What problems are users experiencing that we could solve?

There were 41 pain points identified on the platform and grouped into themes. 
We categorised them by severity using the following method:

**Task failure**
Prevents the user going further
- Search (3)
- User Accounts (3)
- Usability (1)

**Serious problem**
May hinder the user
- Permissions (5)
- Search (2)
- Support (2)
- User Accounts (2)
- Collaboration (1)
- Accessibility (1)
- Positioning (1)
- Training (1)
- Trust (1)
- Usability (1)

**Minor hindrance**
Possible issue, but may not hinder the user
- User Accounts (1)
- Collaboration (2)
- Community (2)
- Permissions (2)
- Reporting (1)
- Safety (1)
- Support (2)
- Usability (3)

### Task Failures

Those which cause task failure and serious problems are primarily issues that could be resolved with best practice design and use of existing design patterns.

#### User Accounts & Registration
- **Users can't easily manage their own account**
- **Users find it difficult to register to the platform**
- **Users without an NHS email can't self-register**
- Unable to merge 2 accounts
- Difficult to manage my own notification settings

#### Permissions
- Cascading permissions are confusing
- Accepting requests to join a workspace creates a lot of overheads for workspace managers
- Setting workspace permissions is unintuitive
- Current breakdown of management roles lacks granularity
- Edit permissions lack customisation

#### Search
- **Users can only search workspaces they’re a member of**
- **Search defaults to current workspace not all workspaces**
- **Searching for content yields poor results**
- Searching for people on the platform isn't optimal
- Low search utility / usage burdens support team
- We found only 1% of sessions were using the search function

#### Usability
- **Session timeouts aren't communicated in advance, leads to lost work**
- Low discoverability of content inside workspaces

## Meeting user needs going forwards

### User needs & featurss to build

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9471595/119965183-e9516e80-bfa1-11eb-9695-8940a299037e.png)

### Features needing investigation

Features needing further investigation

- **Database** - Not enough need shown from quantitative or qualitative analysis
- **Structured Documents** - Currently unable to identify with quant, no user need from qualitative research
- **Survey** - Low feature usage, no user need from qualitative research
- **Calendars** - Interviews with users showed outlook as a preference in some cases

### Features to Remove/Redesign

- **Weblinks**- Low feature usage, usually embedded in other pages
- **Blogs** - Forums are prefered from (not sure on the evidence), have far less usage than Forums and serve similar purpose
- **Picture albums** - Low feature usage, can be served by better document type
- **Task list** - Low feature usage, interviews users stated preferences to other management tools, look into potential integrations.
