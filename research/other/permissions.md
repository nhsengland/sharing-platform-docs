# Permissions   

This page summarises and signposts the key stages of the design process to date, for permissions related to workspaces, content areas and forums within the Future NHS (FNHS) service.   

## What is this?  

Permissions are a critical feature of the FNHS service as they provide workspace managers with the opportunity to control which members can view and collaborate within their workspaces. When creating a new workspace, managers can opt for an â€˜openâ€™ status, whereby anyone can view, share and contribute to the associated content. These workspaces will be visible to all registered users and will appear within related search results. Alternatively they may opt for â€˜restrictedâ€™ status, where workspaces are visible, but in order to view and interact with them, members must request permission. The third possible status is â€˜privateâ€™, which can only be found and viewed by members if they are directly invited by the workspace manager.

This distinction means workspace managers are able to control access to sensitive content and can create highly focused workspaces.  Workspace managers are therefore the predominant users of permissions.

Similar levels of access are applied to content and discussions within forums, sometimes independently of the workspace, meaning that managers can control access at different levels and maintain control of their content. For example restricted content can be put into an open workspace.   

There are multiple user journeys that require the set up and management of permissions in order to complete tasks in an appropriate and secure manner. These include the:
  
- set up of permissions when creating a workspace
- sharing of content within workspaces
- active contributions within workspaces
- centralised management of permissions within a dashboard or admin area


## Current status  

**Status:** ðŸŸ   

The Kahootz  ... None of these improvements were progressed with Kahootz once the focus moved to FNHS 2.0.

Two alternate simplified journeys were designed and user tested for FNHS 2.0:
- journey one 
- journey two etc.

Both of these simplified new registration offered considerable user benefits over the Kahootz process as evidenced by ...

Designs for the new platform were equally usable, with a minor preference for the single form, where users could see at a glance what questions they needed to answer. 
The ultimate decision for the design was expected to depend upon technical review. 

No new designs were implemented into the product as the designs for 2.0 needed to be scaled back for the MVP. 
 

## Recommendations  

### Short term (in Kahootz)  

For the dashboard or home page: 

- Users need to understand 

For the : 

- Reduce the number   

### Long term  

- Allow  

## What we did   

### Kahootz Research  

- [24 Nov 2021](/research/interviews/user-research-20211124.md) - Interviews on **permissions**
- [3 Aug 2021](/research/interviews/user-research-20210803.md) - Interviews on use of **kahootz workspace homepage** and **Managers Wireframes**
- [9 June 2021](/research/interviews/user-research-20210609.md) - Interviews on use of **permissions** and **notifications**

* Analysis of usage data   
- [11 November 2021](/research/quantitative/stats-research-20211111.md) - Analysis of how workspaces use **permissions** on **files** and **folders**. Data from 01 Jan 2020 to 30 June 2021
- [29 October 2021](/research/quantitative/stats-research-20211029.md) - Analysis of how workspaces use **permissions** with regards to **forums**. Data up to 29 October 2021
- [26 October 2021](/research/quantitative/stats-research-20211026.md) - How **Teams permissions** functions are used on the platform. Data up to 26 October 2021
* Review of related support desk tickets   

### FNHS 2.0 Research  

- Design concepts were devised and tested

## Insights  

**Insight 1:**   **Set up process** for workspaces on FNHS

Users sometimes find the workspace definitions of â€˜openâ€™, â€˜restrictedâ€™ and â€˜privateâ€™ ambiguous. They need clarity when creating new workspaces in order to make an appropriate choice. Equivalent clarity needs to be provided when reviewing and editing this status during the lifetime of the workspace. 

To support workspace managers during the set up and editing processes.

**Insight 2:**   Setting up access to **Content**  

The process for adding permissions to content is considered laborious and overly complex, especially when managers are uploading information in bulk. Whether creating â€˜Teamsâ€™ or â€˜Subgroupsâ€™, the user journeys need to be reviewed and simplified in terms of naming, navigation and flow. Users experience different start points for this journey, with the duplication of some elements and these flows would benefit from a redesign that reconsiders the logical stages in the process. 

To simplify the process and improve efficiency.

**Insight 3:**  Intuitive **central area** to manage permissions

Managers find permission management somewhat fragmented and would benefit from a dashboard view where they can centrally manage the permissions of all their workspaces. This area needs to be easy to find and access, plus it needs to enable time and effort savings when editing multiple workspaces, teams and sub-spaces.

To give busy workspace managers access to a single view of their permissions.

 **Insight 4:**  Ability to copy settings across **folders and subfolders**  

There are existing functions available to copy permissions and teams across folders and subfolders. These flow needs to be evaluated and potentially enhanced to ensure the function can be used effectively and consistently across across different user journeys.

To save time and effort from workspace managers.

**Insight 5:**  Expansion of roles to give permissions to **Regional managers** and other non-workspace managers  

Some users requiring acess to permissions are not formal workspace managers. The status of the user group of regional managers - and probably other user groups needs to be reviewed and checked for additional user needs. 

 **Evidence for insights:** Survey and interviews, wireframes and design concepts  

### User needs 

> As a workspace manager, I need the ability to create secure workspaces, so that I can collaborate with the right colleagues.
 
> As a workspace manager, I need to be able to invite everyone to read and contribute to the content I create, so that I give all my colleagues the opportunity to learn, share and connect.

> As a workspace manager, I need to remain aware of what I am sharing and with whom, so that I am in control of sensitive information.

> As a workspace manager, I need an easy way to control who can see all the content I share, so that I donâ€™t waste time searching to make changes. 



### Areas to explore 

Review previous design concepts 

**Challenges** 

Limitations as to what can be achieved within Kahootz and speed at which changes can be applied.
