# Permissions   

This page summarises and signposts the key stages of the design process to date, for permissions related to workspaces, content areas and forums within the Future NHS (FNHS) service.   

## What is this?  

Permissions are a critical feature of the FNHS service as they provide workspace managers with the opportunity to control which members can view and collaborate within their workspaces. When creating a new workspace, managers can opt for an â€˜openâ€™ status, whereby anyone can view, share and contribute to the associated content. These workspaces will be visible to all registered users and will appear within related search results. Alternatively they may opt for â€˜restrictedâ€™ status, where workspaces are visible, but in order to view and interact with them, members must request permission. The third possible status is â€˜privateâ€™, which can only be found and viewed by members if they are directly invited by the workspace manager.

This distinction means workspace managers are able to control access to sensitive content and can create highly focused workspaces.  Workspace managers are therefore the predominant users of permissions.

Similar levels of access are applied to content and discussions within forums, sometimes independently of the workspace, meaning that managers can control access at different levels and maintain control of their content. For example restricted content can be put into an open workspace.   

There are multiple user journeys that require the set up and management of permissions in order to complete tasks in an appropriate and secure manner. These include the:
  
- set up of permissions when creating a workspace
- sharing of content within workspaces
- active contributions within workspaces
- centralised management of permissions within a dashboard or admin area


## Current status  

**Status:** ðŸŸ   

The Kahootz  ... None of these improvements were progressed with Kahootz once the focus moved to FNHS 2.0.

Two alternate simplified journeys were designed and user tested for FNHS 2.0:
- journey one 
- journey two etc.

Both of these simplified new registration offered considerable user benefits over the Kahootz process as evidenced by ...

Designs for the new platform were equally usable, with a minor preference for the single form, where users could see at a glance what questions they needed to answer. 
The ultimate decision for the design was expected to depend upon technical review. 

No new designs were implemented into the product as the designs for 2.0 needed to be scaled back for the MVP. 
 

## Recommendations  

### Short term (in Kahootz)  

For the dashboard or home page: 

- Users need to understand 

For the : 

- Reduce the number   

### Long term  

- Allow  

## What we did   

### Kahootz Research  

- [24 Nov 2021](/research/interviews/user-research-20211124.md) - Interviews on **permissions**
- [3 Aug 2021](/research/interviews/user-research-20210803.md) - Interviews on use of **kahootz workspace homepage** and **Managers Wireframes**
- [9 June 2021](/research/interviews/user-research-20210609.md) - Interviews on use of **permissions** and **notifications**

* Analysis of usage data   
- [11 November 2021](/research/quantitative/stats-research-20211111.md) - Analysis of how workspaces use **permissions** on **files** and **folders**. Data from 01 Jan 2020 to 30 June 2021
- [29 October 2021](/research/quantitative/stats-research-20211029.md) - Analysis of how workspaces use **permissions** with regards to **forums**. Data up to 29 October 2021
- [26 October 2021](/research/quantitative/stats-research-20211026.md) - How **Teams permissions** functions are used on the platform. Data up to 26 October 2021
* Review of related support desk tickets   

### FNHS 2.0 Research  

- Design concepts were devised and tested

### Designs

## Insights  

**Insight 1:**   **Awareness** of FNHS

Users need to have both awareness of FNHS and the motivation to register. This information needs to be presented within channels they use or they may not complete registration.  

To support them in their decision making and encourage them to complete the process.


**Insight 2:**   Authority to **access**  

Users need to understand whether they will be able to access the platform or not. 

To save anyone from unnecessarily completing the process and reassure them it is worth their time. 


**Insight 3:**  Intuitive **flow**

Users are sometimes overwhelmed by the number of options on the login page and may not understand where to start. The page should present a simple hierarchy of options which guide the user.  

To enable intuitive login, reduce complexity and improve ease of use.


 **Insight 4:**  **Quick** access 

NHS users expect to be able to access the platform quickly using their NHS email. 

To save them from setting up new login details and having to remember multiple different logins 

**Insight 5:**  Registration should be **familiar**

Users expect principles of common good practise to apply to the registration for FNHS. For example, information that users provide to FNHS needs to be seen as vital if they are to enter it in a form.  

To simplify and streamline the process of registration.
