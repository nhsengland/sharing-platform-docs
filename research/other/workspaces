# Workspaces   

This page summarises and signposts the key stages of the design process to date for workspaces - the central and dominant feature of the Future NHS (FNHS) service, which enables the sharing of content and subsequent means of collaboration.  

## What is this?  
This includes the creation and management of workspaces by users designated as 'workspace managers' and the utilisation of workspaces by FNHS members. Each of these use cases have been reviewed separately.

User research detailed in this blog has therefore focused on the high-level user journeys of:
- **Workspace managers** creating and maintaining a workspace 
- **Members** viewing and collaborating within a workspace

These journeys are focused on core 'jobs to be done'and defined as primary for employees generally considered to be time-poor. In addition, there are secondary use cases related to the use of specific features and the discovery of new workspaces, people and discussions. 
Improving aspects of discoverability underlies many user needs and has been considered largely within the context of features including search, dashboard and updated homepage. These findings and recommendations have been summarised within a separate blog titled **workspace discovery**.

Historically on FNHS, the majority of workspace managers have agreed that the platform successfully helps build a community and network with the purpose to:
- keep stakeholders informed
- share and collaborate on national, regional, or local guidance and information
- share what works and doesnâ€™t work so everyone can learn faster 
There are variations in the way it is used (for example approximately 30% of National workspace managers use it as a central repository for information, compared to only 10% of regional and local workspace managers.)
However the managers are generally satisfied that the Kahootz platform meets their needs. Usability issues they encounter include some difficulties with permissions and these are detailed in the 'Permissions' blog. 
Some additional secondary areas for improvement include; the ability to easily promote a workspace, identify how a workspace is performing and monitor the impact of changes.  

Overall, workspaces offer significant creative freedom to workspace managers during set up. Arguably too much freedom, since many features are unused and some of the key features require a level of digital literacy and experience to use effectively. 

Furthermore, when too much creative freedom is afforded, the risk of accessability issues for end users increases. There are significant accessiblity requirements in the FNHS user base (disability impairment/digital accessibility, use of assistive technology/adjustments and shared devices)
These needs can come into conflict with the creative freedoms offered to workspace managers. 
There is clearly an important balance between this creativity and the resultant accessibility and as such this is the primary issue that needs to be addressed as a priority. 
Also accessibility for the workspace managers...
Recognising this, there were work done on defining a template approach to simplify the process of workspace creation and generate pages of content that have been thoroughly accessibility tested.

## Current status  

**Status:** AMBER ðŸŸ   

  
 

## Recommendations  

### Short term (in Kahootz)  

* Guidelines for creating accessible workspaces 
* Draft and preview functions

### Long term  

* Full accessible content blocks to build a page
* Assess migration issues  

## What we did   

### Kahootz and new design concept research  
- [21 Sep 2021](/research/interviews/user-research-20210921.md) - Interviews on **design validation** of **groups**, **files** and **folders**, **forums** and **user dashboard**
- [3 Aug 2021](/research/interviews/user-research-20210803.md) - Interviews on use of **kahootz workspace homepage** and **Managers Wireframes**
- [July 2021](/research/surveys/Health&CareSector.md) - Survey conducted with users to help define our **personas**
- [29 April 2021](/research/interviews/user-research-20210429.md) - Interviews on how users use **workspace home pages**, the **page builder** and **forums**
- [July 2020](/research/surveys/managers-survey-202006.md) - Survey conducted with **Workspace Managers** on their use and attitude to the platform to help define our **personas**
 

### FNHS 2.0 Research  

- [July 2022](/research/other/ICS-accessibility.md) - Focussed **accessibility testing** using the beta
- [July 2022](/research/other/ICS-alpha.md) - Protoype testing for **supporting Integrated Care Systems**
- [July 2022](/research/interviews/user-research-20220701.md) - **Usability** testing and heuristic review on the beta

### Designs

## Insights  

**Insight 1:**   Importance of **accessibility** for workspaces on FNHS

Our survey in July 2021 suggested a lack of confidence in using technology for 12% of respondents. 17% used assistive technology or made adjustments to their technology. 
In combination with the statistic that 25% shared a device, these factors will have a significant effect on the usability of complex workspaces for a significant proportion of the user base - both of members and workspace managers. 
In conjunction with the user need of workspace managers to fully support their members, this highlights the importance of improving accessibility and inclusivity upon the platform.
Means we need to support managers better and make the workspaces easier to create.

**Insight 2:**   **Pride**  in creating effective workspaces

Research has surfaced a strong desire and pride to do well by their members in workspace managers.  Want to do a good job. Want it to look good. need it simple to create. Allied with the insight above.

**Insight 3:**   Easy way to set up engaging content on workspaces using **content blocks**  

 strong preference and confidence in block approach for creating interesting and engaging workspaces. Simplify the edit process
 
 **Insight 4:**   Way to create **draft** workspaces and **preview** before pushing to live

 Need to have transparency over what they are creating
 

### User needs 

> As a workspace manager, I need the ability to create and manage effective workspaces, to enable sharing and collaboration.
 
> As a workspace manager, I need my workspaces to be accessible to all, so that I give all my colleagues the opportunity to learn, share and connect.

> As a workspace member, I need workspaces to be easy to access, understand and to interact with, so that I can learn, share and connect.



Do we want discover here or not?? Maybe keep a subsection of insights and needs together.

 **Evidence for insights:** Survey and interviews, wireframes and design concepts  

### User needs 

> As a workspace member, I need to be able to find relevant workspaces, so that I can interact with them.



### Areas to explore 

Review previous design concepts 

**Challenges** 

Limitations as to what can be achieved within Kahootz and speed at which changes can be applied.
