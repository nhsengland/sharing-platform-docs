# Workspace discovery   

This page summarises and signposts the key stages of the design process to date for the discovery of workspaces on the Future NHS (FNHS) service. 
This is concerned with the first time use of the service following registration and ongoing visits where users may discover or search for new workspaces, groups or content.

## What is this?  
In many instances, workspace managers who create and manage workspaces, invite specific members to view and use their workspaces. These members (or prospective members) receive a link directly to the workspace and once they are registered, they are able to easily access the content. 
This scenario represents a primary use case of FNHS since it enables core functions of sharing and collaboration within a group and this topic is summarised in the blogs titled [Workspaces](/research/other/workspaces.md) and [Permissions](/research/other/permissions.md).

However, an additional enabling use case to widen sharing and collaboration within open workspaces, is the ability for members to **discover** for themselves new workspaces, people and topics in order to broaden their learning.
Aspects of this discovery underlie many user needs and have largely been considered within the context of features including search, dashboard and a customised homepage. 


User research detailed in this blog has focused on supporting users to broaden their knowledge via the high-level user journeys of:

- Members **passively discovering** new workspaces and initiatives (via platform push technology)
- Members **actively searching** for new workspaces and topics (via user action)


Within the context of:
- an email invitation (first time user)
- homepage (or dashboard)
- contextual and site-wide search


## Current status  

**Status:** AMBER ðŸŸ   

Significant user research was conducted, testing design concepts with users in April, August and September 2021. Multiple ideas for features within Homepage and Dashboard were perceived as overlapping and sometimes confusing. 

Overall, the idea of customised content and recommended workspaces on the homepage was well received, in combination with a well-placed search field to locate more. 
And of course, acknowledging that recommendations are only useful if they are accurate and relevant.
 

Ultimately however, many users click on links from their email and do not return to their homepage on a regular basis. This means that the global **search** field is often their default feature to find content and workspaces.
Research around the search experience showed gaps in the experience, which could be improved by following good practise in global search and by potentially introducing a contextual search function to workspaces.
Additionally, it emphasises the importance of developing effective email updates as detailed in the blog titled [Notifications](/research/other/notifications.md). 


The **first time** user experience of FNHS 2.0 was explored in depth within the remit of registration research (April 22). This identified a number of ideas for improvement, which could be followed up with Kahootz. 
Given that many users don't return to the homepage, improving the first time experience arguably becomes more important, if we are keen to provide a reason to return to the homepage to support discovery.
Note that no new designs were implemented into the product FNHS 2.0, as the designs were scaled back for MVP. 
 
 
Learnings from all this research need to be condensed into some simple recommendations for improved content discovery, in the form of recommendations, the ability to search and improved search results. 
These will require a degree of prioritisation before they are presented to and evaluated by Kahootz. 


## Recommendations  

### Short term (in Kahootz)  

* Evaluate the feasibility of implementing personalised homepages that promote related content and workspaces (or groups) to members. Check the design concepts for homepage to establish the most meaningful and
simplest features and look for quick wins from existing Kahootz functionality.
* Review the design concepts for registration and homepage journeys to identify any quick wins relating to the email invitation and the homepage for arrival by first time users.
* Review features of search and search results by Kahootz 
* Extract key recommendations for improvement and submit to Kahootz for evaluation

### Long term  

* Progress the design concept for customised homepage and integrate in-page context search where appropriate
* Design optimal search results pages and flows
* Assess migration issues  

## What we did   

### Kahootz and new design concept research  
- [21 Sep 2021](/research/interviews/user-research-20210921.md) - Interviews on **design validation** of **groups**, **files and folders**, forums and **user dashboard**
- [3 Aug 2021](/research/interviews/user-research-20210803.md) - Interviews on use of **kahootz workspace homepage** and **managers wireframes**
- [29 April 2021](/research/interviews/user-research-20210429.md) - Interviews on how users use **workspace home pages**, the **page builder**  


### FNHS 2.0 Research  

- [July 2022](/research/other/ICS-alpha.md) - **Prototype** testing for supporting Integrated Care Systems - **groups** and **search**
- [July 2022](/research/interviews/user-research-20220701.md) - **Usability** testing and heuristic review on the beta - **groups** and **search**
- [17 April 2022](/research/interviews/user-research-20220417.md) - Prototype testing for **registration**

## Insights  


**Insight 1:**   Importance of information for **first time** users

Users receiving an email invitation to join a workspace (group) on FNHS, need information about the workspace and a reason to proceed. This need continues
once they have successfully signed up and arrived on their homepage and this part of the user journey needs to be better supported.

**Insight 2:**   Many users **bypass** the  homepage, thus increasing the importance of email updates

Many users click on links from their emails to enter FNHS to a specific workspace and do not return to their homepage. This behaviour results in less opportunities to discover new content, workspaces and colleagues. 
This presents a significant challenge on how to broaden the experience for these users and the importance of creating useful and timely email updates.

**Insight 3:**   Importance of relevant **homepage** for workspaces on FNHS
 
 Users of FNHS are time-poor employees and do not have time to browse without purpose on the service. Any recommendations for content and workspaces need to be highly relevant and useful. 
 Furthermore, these have to be immediately established as useful from the first time they are used.
 
 **Insight 4:**   **Search** experience is lacking  

 The global search does not provide optimised results that support a range of discovery use cases.
 
 

 

### User needs 

> As a member, I need the ability to find new workspaces and colleagues, so that I can broaden my knowledge and networks.

> As a member, I need to be able to find specific information that is relevant to me, so that I can do my job effectively.
 
> As a member, I want to know about workspaces relevant to me, so that I can broaden my knowledge and networks.
 


 **Evidence for insights:** Survey and interviews, wireframes and design concepts  



### Areas to explore 

Review previous design concepts to evaluate potential updates to the existing Kahootz platform.

**Challenges** 

Limitations as to what can be achieved within Kahootz and speed at which changes can be applied.
