# Which members uploads folders?

## Objective
To understand the user role on the platform who create folders. The assumption is that this is in the mainly done by workspace managers.

## Data
The sample data this analysis was run on was from the 1 May 2021 to the 11 Jul 2021. 
During this period 5,521 workspace managers logged onto the platform and 16,199 folders were created on the platform 
(excluding one workspace that had uploaded an abnormally large amount of content during this period)

## Results
- 16,199 folders were created by 1673 individual platform users
- 461 (28%) of the users who created folders were not workspace managers
- 3,088 (19%) folders were created by members who were not workspace managers
- 762 workspaces had folders created in them
- 151 (20%) of workspaces had folders created by members who were not workspace managers
- 5,521 workspace managers logged into the platform during the reporting period
- 4,309 (78%) of workspace managers who logged into the platform did not create a folder

The following graphs show the distribution of the numbers of folders created between workspaces

As you can see, only a minority of workspaces tended to create significant numbers of folders. This is also reflected when you take workspace manager created folders out of the data.
