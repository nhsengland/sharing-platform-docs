# Use of Teams function

## Introduction
The following report was produced to investigate the use of the Teams permissions function on the current FutureNHS platform by workspaces. Data was taken up to the 25 Oct 2021 from the start of the platform.

## Findings
From the data we found

- **850 workspaces** have used **at least one Team** (out of the 2,525 workspaces on the platform ~34%)
- **75%** of workspaces who use Teams have **under 100 items** on their workspace that have **permissions assigned to a Team**
- **21 workspaces** have **over 1,000 items** on their workspace that have **permissions assigned to a Team**
- **95% of items** have **under 5 Teams assigned** to them
- **4 items** have **40+ Teams assigned** to them!

A histogram showing the distribution of the amount of items per workspace that have Teams permissions is shown below:

It is not yet possible to report on the number of different Teams and workspace has, but this is being developed.
