# Use of Forums

## Introduction
The following report was produced from looking at the data around how Forums are used on the FutureNHS platform. Data was taken up to 17 March 2021.

## Findings
From the data we found:

**Forums**
- There are **3,282 forums** on the platform
- These forums have been **created by 896 separate workspaces**
- **20%** of those forums can be **attributed to just 7 workspaces**
- 62 workspaces have 10 or more forums
- **4 workspaces have 100 or more forums!!!**

**Forum messages**
- In 2021 to date so far 13,060 messages have been exchanged on the platform
- **10,368 have been identified as forum posts**
- These can be **attributed to 420 forums in 252 workspaces**
- **22% of these forum posts can be traced to 1 workspace**
- **15% of these forum posts can be traced to 1 single forum**
- **70% forum posts** are taking place in only **36 forums in 22 workspaces**

## Conclusion
Forums whilst still popular, aren't as widespread across the platform as was originally assumed. Only 10% of workspaces have an active forum and of those you could argue only 1% of workspaces really forums that are being used consistently.
 
Use of forums by workspaces is also quite sparodic. Some workspaces have over 100 forums each on their workspaces presenting a poor experience for users.
 
There are some workspaces with 1 very active workspace. We need to study these and learn how they are generating user value from their forum.
