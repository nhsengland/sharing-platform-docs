# Forum Permissions

## Introduction
The following analysis was conducted on data from the FutureNHS platform up until the 29 October 2021. It looks at how workspaces on the platform use permissions with regards to their forums.


## Method
There are 4,198 forums on the platform in 1,233 workspaces, however many of these are not active. To identify active workspaces we have used the following criteria:
1. Has the forum received a new message since the start of the year (01 Jan 2021)
2. Has the forum in total received 5 or more messages?

Applying the above criteria to the forums on the platform we now have 95 active forums in 66 workspaces. This analysis has also highlighted that only 10 workspaces on the platform have 2 or more active forums.


## Findings

Out of the 95 active forums on the platform, only 7 (7%) of them have used permissions to limit views of the forums to particular teams on their workspaces.
This would suggest that the ability for forums to have extra permissions outside of the overarching workspace settings in general is not needed.

## Next steps

We will look to speak to the workspaces who have applied permissions to their forums to understand why the reasons behind why they have done this.
