# Workspace Membership

The following is a short piece of analysis that was run on the membership of users within the FutureNHS Collaboration platform.
The following report was run from the platform
- Users ID and the Workspace IDs from which then were a member
- Only users who had accessed the platform in the period 01 Jan 2021 to 31 Mar 2021.

## Results

This is what we found:

The majority of platform users, 67%, were members of 2 or less workspaces. 
As all members of the platform are automatically added to the platform homepage workspace this suggests that the majority of users do not join or take part in more than a single workspace.

After this, 25% of users are members of 3 to 5 workspaces, with the remaining 9% being members of 5 or more workspaces.
It's worth noting that this does not show how active members are in these workspaces.

## Questions this poses...

The above data raises the following questions:
- Why do users in general not venture out of a single workspace?
- What value are users missing from not exploring other workspaces?
- How active across more than one workspace are the users that are members of multiple workspaces?
- Who are the 9% of users in 5 or more workspaces and what value are they getting from the multiple workspace membership?
