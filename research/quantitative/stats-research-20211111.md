# Folder and File Permissions

## Introduction
The following analysis was conducted on data of folders and files created on the FutureNHS platform from 01 Jan 2020 to the 30 June 2021. 
It looks at how workspaces on the platform use permissions with regards to their folders and files.

## Findings

18 months after the 01 Jan 2020 a total of 588,613 folders and files were created on the FutureNHS platform with 1,578 workspaces. 
At the end of the reporting period there were 2,314 workspaces on the platform, so 68% of these had created a new folder or file.

From these data, this is what we found:

### Files
- 466,649 files had been created in 1,446 workspaces
#### View Permissions
- 45% of these were viewable to all members (i.e. no permissions)
- 1% were locked down to be viewable to only managers
- The remaining 54% had view permissions applied to them using Teams
- 551 workspaces out of 1,446 (38%) had not put view permissions on their files

#### Edit Permissions
- 40% of files had no edit permissions applied (i.e. any member could edit them)
- 9% had edit permissions as manager only with the remaining 51% having permissions set at a Teams level

### Folders
- 121,964 folders had been created in 1,497 workspaces
#### View Permissions
- 49% of these were viewable to all members (i.e. no permissions)
- 3% were locked down to be viewable to only managers
- The remaining 48% had view permissions applied to them using Teams
- 622 workspaces out of 1,446 (38%) had not put view permissions on their files

#### Edit Permissions
- 32% of files had no edit permissions applied (i.e. any member could edit them)
- 16% had edit permissions as manager only with the remaining 51% having permissions set at a Teams level 

## Next steps

We will look to speak to the workspaces who have applied permissions to their forums to understand why the reasons behind why they have done this.
