# Workspace Manager Survey results

## Summary of findings
**The primary persona is a workspace manager**, and it is common for this person to perform all roles of the possible persona roles (i.e. administrator, editor, owner and promoter).

**The primary goal** of all respondents that FutureNHS supports is to **share knowledge and best practices with the wider NHS**.

**The key activities** the respondents use the platform for are to **send interesting information** they find useful **to their colleagues, find and read information that might help them** in their role, and **contact people** in their network **outside of their organisation**.

Some other activities the respondents use the platform for are to contribute to discussions about topics they have knowledge in, write about and share things they’ve learnt that might help others in their role, and connect with and grow a network of peers in a similar role to theirs.

The **primary purposes of workspaces** are to **keep stakeholders informed** of what they are doing, **collaborate**, **gather input** on, and **share national, regional, or local guidance**.

The **secondary purposes of all workspaces** are to **build a community** to **connect users** and **provide a space to collaborate** with them.

**Workspaces mainly use email newsletters to promote their workspace**; half the respondents said it is important for them to be able to easily promote their workspace, and only 60% of those said they’re currently satisfied with their ability to do so.

## User Profiles
- **Manager**: A respondent who said they do most or all roles​
- **Owner**: Primarily has accountability for the workspace, but may also manage/process members or content on occasion ​
- **Administrator**: Primarily responsible for processing workspace members and producing reports​
- **Editor**: Primarily responsible for managing the workspace on a daily basis and producing/editing content​
- **Promoter**: Primarily responsible for workspace comms and marketing

**38%** of responses were **users who conduct the activities of more than one of these user profiles**; these have been categorised as ‘Manager’.

 Predominantly these users are either responsible for managing the workspace on a day to day basis, managing and processing workspace members (admin/editor roles) or have overall accountability for the workspace (owner role)

## Workspace purposes by organisation

100% of respondents who work for both **NHS England & Improvement, or just NHS Improvement** said that the purpose of their workspace is to:
- keep stakeholders informed
- collaborate on, gather input on and share national, regional, or local guidance
- provide a place to collaborate with users on content

Only 50% of respondents who work for NHS Improvement said that the purpose of their workspace is to:
- share national, regional, or local guidance
- build a community across disparate teams and organisations
- encourage open discussion and feedback on pieces of content

80-85% members who work for NHS England said the purpose of their workspace was to:
- Help users to find and connect with other individuals working on similar topics
- Keep stakeholders informed of what we are doing
- Provide a place to collaborate with users on content
- Sharing national, regional, or local guidance
- Provide a place to share what works/doesn’t so we can all learn faster

For non-NHS England or Improvement organisations the purpose of workspaces tend to be more for the purposes of collaborating and gathering input on guidance and building a community.

## Promoting workspaces
The most common method of promotion amongst respondents was through email news bulletins. For those workspaces that are private the preferred method is via private invite.

## Expectations vs Reality

Majority of respondents said that it is important to them that the platform helps to build a community and network and this seems to be currently true.

What is currently true but less important is that users feel comfortable communicating openly on the platform.

Some areas for improvement are the ability to easily promote a workspace, and identify how a workspace is performing and monitor the impact of changes.
