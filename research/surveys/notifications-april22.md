## Updates and notifications - Survey results April 2022    
Quantitative analysis of a survey distributed to existing users of FutureNHS on the topic of updates.

#### Method
MS Forms survey emailed to existing users, open for 1 week commencing 31 March 2022.

#### Responses
71 responses; 19 from managers, 52 from members

### Research goals
Questions were mainly oriented around existing practises with updates and the value attributed towards them. Goals were to:
- quantify and validate the needs of FutureNHS users with regards to updates
- check for the different needs between workspace managers and members
- collect feedback on the current Kahootz service updates and notifications
- collect feedback on some design ideation completed by the FutureNHS team

The survey helped us identify:
- user needs relating to the frequency of updates
- user needs relating to the content of updates
- user needs relating to management of updates
- how well user needs are perceived to be met by the Kahootz service


### Summary of findings

#### Section 1. Expectations, needs and wants relating to updates
- Managers and members have different expectations and needs 
- Managers are generally more dependent on updates and notifications than members
- All expected updates via email and on the platform itself via a dashboard or a newsletter 
- Preferred channel for updates is email
- Some updates are considered more important than others and the relative importance of updates has a bearing on frequency 
- Managers strongly prefer the frequency to vary according to update type e.g. requests to join should be immediate
- Managers and members want to control the number and nature of updates they receive

#### Section 2. Kahootz updates
The Net Promoter Score **(NPS)** rating was applied to the existing Kahootz service.
Respondents were asked the question 'How effective are the updates you receive on FutureNHS?' 
40 out of the 71 participants (with an equal proportion between managers and members) provided a rating of <7 out of 10 and therefore scored the service as **Detractors**. 

**Note:** The NPS is a widely used market research metric calculated from a single survey question with a range of ten response options. Users scoring your service >7 are likely to actively promote your service to others and are referred to as ‘Promoters’, whereas users scoring your service <7 are likely to actively talk about your service in a negative way and they are referred to as ‘Detractors’. 

**Negative** feedback on the existing updates included:
- Too many emails
- Overwhelming emails
- Unhelpful subject lines
- Difficulty managing notifications
- Notifications for empty folders

**Positive** feedback included:
- Weekly email summary
- Notification preferences for different workspaces and forums

 #### Section 3. Design concepts
- Responses suggested preferences for designs that included recognisable patterns consistent with mental models formed from social media platforms for example Facebook and LinkedIn
- Emails that allowed users to deep link to specific content and calls to action were strongly preferred
- Notification icons using bright colours in typical positions were more noticable
